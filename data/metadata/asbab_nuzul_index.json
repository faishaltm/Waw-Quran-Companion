And so when he went\nout, he heard the calling: 'O Muhammad!' He said: 'Here I am! At your service!' The caller said: 'Say: I bear\nwitness that there is no god but Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah'. Then\nhe said: 'Say (Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Owner of the Day of\nJudgement...)' and he read until the end of the Opening of the Book”. This is also the opinion of 'Ali ibn Abi\nTalib. Abu Ishaq Ahmad ibn Muhammad, the Qur'anic commentator, informed us>al-Hasan ibn Ja'far, the\ncommentator who said: Abu'l-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn Mahmud al-Marwazi> 'Abd Allah ibn Mahmud al-\nSa'di> Abu Yahya al-Qasri> Marwan ibn Mu'awiyah> al-'Ala' ibn al-Musayyab> al-Fudayl ibn 'Amr> 'Ali ibn\nAbi Talib who said: “The Opening of the Book was revealed in Mecca from a treasure beneath the divine\nThrone”. And through the same chain of transmission> al-Sa'di who said: 'Amr ibn Salih informed us> his\nfather> al-Kalbi> Abu Salih> ibn 'Abbas who said: “The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, stood\nup once in Mecca and said: 'In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. Praise be to Allah, Lord of\nthe Worlds'. The people of Quraysh said: 'May Allah strike your mouth' or something to this effect”. This was\nrelated by al-Hasan and Qatadah. But according to Mujahid, the Opening of the Book was revealed in\nMedina. About this opinion al-Husayn ibn al-Fadl said: “Every scholar has a lapse, and this is one lapse from\nMujahid, since he is the only scholar who holds this opinion while all the other scholars disagree with him”.\nWhat makes the Opening of the Book categorically a Meccan Surah is the saying of Allah, exalted is He: (We\nhave given thee seven of the oft-repeated (verses) and the great Qur'an), i.e. the Opening of the Book.\nMuhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Nahwi informed us> Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn 'Ali al-Hiri> Ahmad ibn\n'Ali ibn al-Muthanna> Yahya ibn Ayyub> Isma'il ibn Ja'far> al-'Ala'> his father> Abu Hurayrah who said:\n“When Ubayy ibn Ka'b finished reading the Opening of the Book to him, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, said: 'By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, Allah has not revealed the like of it in the\nTorah, the Gospel, the Psalm or in the Qur'an. Verily, I was given the seven oft-repeated [i.e. al-Fatihah]\nand the great Qur'an' ”. Furthermore, there is no disagreement that Surah al-Hijr was revealed in Mecca. It\nfollows therefore that Allah would not mention His bounty on the Prophet for giving him the Opening of the\nBook while in Mecca and then reveal this to him in Medina. Again, one cannot possibly say that Allah's\nMessenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, stayed over ten years in Mecca and prayed during this time\nwithout the Opening of the Book. This is inconceivable.",

Then Allah revealed this verse”. Said ‘Umar ibn Hubshi: “I asked Ibn ‘Umar about\nthis verse and he said: ‘Go to Ibn ‘Abbas and ask him’. The latter said: ‘There was on al-Safa an idol in the\nform of a man called Isaf, and on al-Marwah an idol in the form of a woman called Na’ilah. The people of\nthe Book claimed that these two had committed adultery in the Ka’bah and as a punishment Allah turned\nthem into two stones which were placed on al-Safa and al-Marwah so that people can take heed. But after a\nlong time had passed, they were worshipped instead of Allah, exalted is He. Whenever the people of the\npre-Islamic period went in between them, they stroked the two idols. When Islam came and the idols were\ndestroyed, the Muslims disliked going between al-Safa and al-Marwah because of these two idols. And as a\nresponse, Allah revealed this verse’ ”. Said al-Suddi: “In the pre-Islamic period, the devils used to emit\nnoises at night between al-Safa and al-Marwah between which idols were placed. When Islam emerged, the\nMuslims said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! We will not go in between al-Safa and al-Marwah, for this is a practice\nof idolatry which we used to do in the pre-Islamic period’. As a response, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this\nverse”.

The following day he fainted in\nthe middle of the day. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab also had sexual intercourse with his wife after he found her\n\n\nsleeping. He mentioned what had happened to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and the\nverse was (is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast...) was revealed, up to\nAllah’s saying (...of the dawn.). The Muslims were very happy with this”. Abu ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi\nHamid> Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad al-Shaybani> Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman al-\nDaghuli> al-Za‘farani> Shababah> Isra’il> Abu Ishaq> al-Bara’ who said: “The Companions of Muhammad,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, when one of them was fasting and was still sleeping at the advent of\nthe time of breaking the fast, he was not allowed to eat that night or the following day until the advent of\nthe time of breaking the fast of the following day. Qays ibn Sirma al-Ansari was fasting. When the time of\nbreaking fast came, he went to his wife and asked her: ‘Do you have any food?’ She said: ‘No! But I will go\nand find something for you’. As he was working all day, he fell asleep. When his wife came back and saw\nthat he had slept, she said: ‘What a disappointment!’ And so he had to carry on his fast. At midday on the\nfollowing day, he fainted. He mentioned what had happened to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace. Then the verse (It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast...), and\nthey were overjoyed”. Narrated by Bukhari from ‘Ubayd Allah ibn Musa from Isra’il. Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad\nal-Farisi informed us> Muhammad ibn al-Fadl> Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Hafiz> Muhammad\nibn Yahya> Hisham ibn ‘Ammar> Yahya ibn Hamzah> Ishaq ibn Abi Farwah> al-Zuhri> al-Qasim ibn\nMuhammad who said: “At the beginning of the prescription of fasting, one used to fast from the night to the\nfollowing night. Once one went to sleep, one could not touch one’s wife or eat or sleep. That is until ‘Umar\nwent to his wife and seeing that he wanted to sleep with her, she told him that she had slept. ‘Umar slept\nwith her anyhow. Sirma ibn Anas also was fasting and slept before he broke his fast—that is because once\nthey slept they could not eat or drink — and had, therefore to fast until the following day. Fasting was so\nhard on them that it nearly killed them, and so Allah, glorified and exalted is He, sent down this dispensation\nand revealed (and He hath turned in mercy toward you and relieved you...)”. Sa‘id ibn Muhammad al-Zahid>\nhis grandfather> Abu ‘Amr al-Hiri> Muhammad ibn Yahya> Ibn Abi Maryam> Abu Ghassan> Abu Hazim>\nSahl ibn Sa‘d who said: “The verse (... and eat and drink until the white thread becometh distinct to you\nfrom the black thread...) but (of the dawn) was not revealed yet. As a result, when one of them wanted to\nfast, he tied one white thread and another black thread to his legs and ate and drank until he could\ndistinguish between the two threads. Allah then revealed (... of the dawn), and understood from the verse\nthat Allah meant by the black and white threads the night and day”. Narrated by Bukhari from the report of\nIbn Abi Maryam, and also by Muslim from the report of Muhammad ibn Sahl from Ibn Abi Maryam.",

Abu Bakr al-Tamimi\n\n\ninformed us> Abu’l-Shaykh> Abu Yahya al-Razi> Sahl ibn ‘Ubayd> ‘Ubayda> al-A‘mash> Abu Sufyan> Jabir\nwho said: “The tribe of Quraysh used to be called al-Humus. Their members used to enter through doors\nwhile in ritual consecration. Once, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was in a\nwalled field [while in a state of consecration]. When he left this field, he used the door. Qutbah ibn ‘Amir al-\nAnsari who was with him went out right behind him. People said: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Qutbah ibn ‘Amir al-\nAnsari is an impious person. He went out after you, using the door’. The Prophet then asked him: ‘Why did\nyou do it?’ Qutbah said: ‘I saw you doing it and I followed your example’. The Prophet said: ‘But I am\nAhmasi [i.e. from al-Humus]’. Qutbah replied: ‘But your religion is my religion’. And because of this Allah\nrevealed (It is not righteousness that ye go to houses by the backs thereof...)”. The commentators of the\nQur’an said: “In the pre-Islamic period and beginning of the Islamic period, a man did not enter a walled\nfield, room or house from its door once he was in ritual consecration. If the man happened to be a city\ndweller, he would dig a hole at the back of his house and use it to come in and go out; or alternately use a\nladder to get to his house from the top. If the man was a nomad, he would use the back of his tent. He\nwould never enter from the door until the end of his ritual consecration. People considered this as part of\nthe religion, and this applied to all unless one was of al-Humus who include: Quraysh, Kinanah, Khuza‘ah,\nThaqif, Khath‘am, Banu ‘Amir ibn Sa‘sa‘ah and Banu’l-Nadr ibn Mu‘awiyah. These were called al-Humus\nbecause of their intense adherence to their religion. It so happened that one day the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, entered a house which belonged to one of the Helpers. One man of the\nHelpers, who happened to be in ritual consecration, followed him through the door. People censored him for\ndoing so, and the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, asked him: ‘Why did you go\nthrough the door while in ritual consecration?' The man said: ‘I saw you entering through the door and I\nfollowed you’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘But I am Ahmasi [i.e. of al-\nHumus]!’ The man said: ‘If you are Ahmasi, then so am I: our religion is one; I have accepted your\nguidance, way and religion’. As a result, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”.",

The Qurashites who accompanied the caravan\nincluded 'Amr ibn al-Hadrami, al-Hakam ibn Kaysan, 'Uthman ibn 'Abd Allah ibn al-Mughirah, Nawfal ibn 'Abd\nAllah, the latter two being from the Banu Makhzum. When these men saw the Companions of the Messenger\nof Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, they became scared. 'Abd Allah ibn Jahsh said: 'They are\nscared of you. Let one of you shave his head and then go to them. Once they see his shaved head, they will\nfeel safe, thinking that we are pilgrims'. They shaved the head of 'Ukashah who then went to them. When\nthey saw him, they said: 'These are pilgrims, no harm shall come to you', and felt therefore safe. This was\non the last day of Jumada II. But they were not absolutely certain whether it was the last day of Jumada II\n\n\nor the first day of Rajab. They deliberated with each other. Some of them said: 'If you let them go tonight,\nthe sacred month will begin and then you will be safe from them'. They all agreed to attack those people.\nWaqid ibn 'Abd Allah al-Tamimi threw an arrow at 'Amr ibn al-Hadrami and killed him. He was the first\nidolater to be killed by a Muslim. Al-Hakam and 'Uthman were taken prisoners. These were the first\nprisoners in Islam. Nawfal, on the other hand, escaped and could not be captured by the Muslims. The\nbelievers then led the camels and the two prisoners and went back to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, in Medina. The Quraysh cried: 'Muhammad has violated the sacred month, a month\nin which the one who is fearful is safe and the period when people spread for their livelihoods. He has shed\nblood and taken other people's properties as booty in this sacred month'. The people of Mecca heaved abuse\nat the Muslims who were still among them. They said: 'O apostates! You have violated the sacred month by\nyour engagement in fighting'. The Jews took this incident as a good omen. When the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, heard of this, he said to 'Abd Allah ibn Jahsh and his fellow companions:\n'I did not command you to fight in the sacred month', and he suspended his judgement concerning the\ncaptured caravan and the two prisoners. Those who took part in this military expedition were mortified; they\nthought they were doomed and felt utterly helpless. They said: 'O Messenger of Allah! We killed Ibn al-\nHadrami and in the evening we saw the moon of Rajab. We do not know therefore whether we had killed\nhim in the month of Jumada II or in Rajab'. People debated this matter a great deal, and then Allah, exalted\nis He, revealed (They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month). At that\npoint, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, kept a fifth of the caravan - this was the\nfirst fifth ever taken in Islam - and divided the rest on those who took part in the military expedition, and\nthis became the first booty ever captured in Islam. The people of Mecca then sent for ransom for their\nprisoners. But the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'No, we shall wait until Sa'd and 'Utbah\ncome back. If they fail to come back, we will kill the prisoners in retaliation'. When 'Utbah and Sa'd came\nback, the two prisoners were ransomed”. As for al-Hakam ibn Kaysan, he later embraced Islam and stayed\nwith the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, in Medina. He was martyred in the Battle\nof Bi'r Ma'unah. 'Uthman ibn 'Abd Allah went back to Mecca and died there as a disbeliever. Nawfal had\nforced his horse, at the Battle of the Ditch, to jump over the ditch. He fell with his horse in the ditch, causing\nhis death and the death of his horse. Allah, exalted is He, killed him there and when the idolaters requested\nto retrieve his corpse in exchange for money, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give peace, said:\n“Take him! His corpse is vile and his blood money is vile too”. This is then the occasion of revelation of the\nsaying of Allah, exalted is He: (They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred\nmonth...) as well as that of the subsequent verse.",

There were things that happened due to the\nconsumption of intoxicants, before they were made lawful, which the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, disliked. Of these is the story of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and Hamzah, may Allah be well\npleased with them. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya informed us> Abu Bakr ibn Abi\nKhalid> Yusuf ibn Musa al-Marwazi> Ahmad ibn Salih> ‘Anbasah> Yusuf> Ibn Shihab> ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn>\nHusayn ibn ‘Ali who related that ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib said: “I had an old camel mare which was my share from\nthe booty of Badr. Before that, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, had given me an\nold camel mare from the quint (khums). And when I was going to marry Fatimah, I had an appointment with\na goldsmith from Banu Qaynuqa‘ whom I wanted to travel with me to buy Bulrush (Idhkhir) from a\ngoldsmith for my wedding ceremony. I went to gather some saddles, sacks and ropes — for my camels\nwhich were kneeled down close to a Helper’s room. When I came back, I found my two camels with their\n\n\nhumps cut off, their haunches ripped open and their insides taken away. I could not believe what I saw, and\nasked: ‘Who did this?’ They said: ‘It was Hamzah ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib; he is now in the house drinking with\nsome Helpers. They have a songstress who had sung: O Hamzah, proceed to the old fat camels Which are\ntied in the courtyard. Put the knife to their throat And, O Hamzah, smear blood on them. And feed us from\ntheir slices, meat on skewer attached together on glowing fire. For you are, O Abu ‘Umarah, our hope To\nrelieve us from harm and affliction. So when he heard this, he jumped to his sword, cut off the camels’\nhumps, ripped open their haunches and took away their insides’. I proceeded until I entered in on the\nProphet, Allah bless him and give him peace. He had with him Zayd ibn Harithah. The Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, knew why I went to see him. He said: ‘What’s the matter with you?’ I\nsaid: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have not seen anything like what I saw today. Hamzah attacked my camels,\ncut off their humps, ripped open their haunches and he is still drinking until now in a certain house’. The\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, called for his outer garment and walked off. Zayd\nibn Harithah and I followed him. He proceeded until he arrived to the house where Hamzah was drinking. He\nasked permission to enter and permission was granted. They were all drunk. The Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, began reproaching Hamzah for what he did while Hamzah’s eyes were red\nfrom being completely drunk. Hamzah looked at the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace;\nthen he stared at him, looked at his knees, then stared at his face and said: ‘Are you not but the slaves of\nmy father?’ The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, realised that he was very drunk. He\nstepped back, left the house and we left after him”. Narrated by Bukhari from Ahmad ibn Salih.

The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'O 'Abd Allah! She is a\nbeliever!' 'Abd Allah said: 'By Him who has sent you with the truth, I will set her free and marry her'. And he\ndid. A group of Muslims reproached him for doing so, saying: 'He married a slave!' This is because Muslims\nwere still looking forward to marry idolatresses and marry their own daughters to idolaters, out of desire for\ntheir noble lineages. Allah, exalted is He, therefore revealed about them (for lo! a believing bondwoman is\nbetter than an idolatress though she please you...)”. Ibn 'Abbas is reported to have said according to the\nnarration of al-Kalbi from Abu Salih: “The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent a\nman from Ghaniyy called Marthad ibn Abi Marthad, an ally of Banu Hashim, to Mecca to try to free some\nMuslims who were held prisoners there. When Marthad reached Mecca, a woman called 'Anaq heard of his\narrival and went to see him. This woman used to be his mistress in the pre-Islamic period but when he\nembraced Islam, he abandoned her. She said to him: 'Woe unto you, O Marthad! Should we not go\nsomewhere secluded?' He said: 'Islam has placed a barrier between you and I and seclusion with you is\nforbidden for me. However, if you wish, I will marry you. When I return back to the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, I will seek his permission and marry you'. She said to him: 'Do you\nrefuse the like of me?' She then cried for help, and Marthad was beaten up very badly before they let him\ngo. When he finished his business in Mecca, he went back to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and\ngive him peace, and informed him about 'Anaq and what he went through because of her. He then asked: 'O\nMessenger of Allah! Is it lawful for me to marry her?' Allah revealed this verse forbidding him from marrying\nher (Wed not idolatresses till they believe...)”.",

Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Mutawwi'i informed us> Abu 'Amr ibn Hamdan> Abu 'Ali>\nZuhayr> Yunus ibn Muhammad> Ya'qub al-Qummi> Ja'far> Sa'id ibn Jubayr> Ibn 'Abbas who said: “ 'Umar\nibn al-Khattab went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said to him: 'I have\nperished!' The Prophet exclaimed: 'And what is the reason of your peril?' He said: 'I turned over the carriage\nof my camel'. He said: 'The Prophet did not answer him. But then this verse (Your women are a tilth for you\n(to cultivate) so go to your tilth as ye will) was revealed to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\n\n\nhim peace'. Meaning: penetrate your wives from the front and from the back, but avoid penetrating them in\nthe anus or during their menstruation”. Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Asfahani informed us> 'Abd\nAllah ibn Muhammad al-Hafiz> Abu Yahya al-Razi> Sahl ibn 'Uthman> al-Muharibi> Layth> Abu Salih> Sa'id\nibn al-Musayyab who was asked about the saying of Allah (... so go to your tilth as ye will) and he said:\n“This was revealed about coitus interruptus”. And in the report of al-Kalbi, Ibn 'Abbas said: “This was\nrevealed about the Emigrants after they settled in Medina. They mentioned having sex with their wives from\nthe front and back positions and did not see any harm in doing so as long as the penetration was done in\nthe women's sexual organ. The Helpers and Jews who were present condemned this and mentioned that the\nonly lawful way of sleeping with one's wife is to do it from the front position. The Jews also mentioned that\nthey find in the Torah that it is filth in the sight of Allah to sleep with one's wife in any other position than\nwhen the wife is lying on her back, and failing to do so is the cause why children are born cross-eyed or\nmentally disturbed. The Muslims mentioned this to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, saying: 'In the pre-Islamic period and after we embraced Islam we always had sex with our wives in\nany position we liked. The Jews have condemned us for doing so and, further, claimed this and that'. And so\nAllah, exalted is He, gave the lie to the Jews and revealed this verse to give dispensation (... so go to your\ntilth as ye will.) He says: the sexual organ of the wife is the plantation where the child grows (... so go to\nyour tilth as ye will), meaning: from in front of her and from behind her as long as the penetration is done in\nher sexual organ”.",

When the wild animals went away, birds came\nforward and ate of the carrion, and whatever fell from them, the wind scattered it away in the air. Ibrahim\nwas amazed when he saw this. He said: ‘O Lord! I know very well that you will gather its parts, please show\n\n\nme how you bring it to life, so that I can see it with my own eyes’ ”. Said Ibn Zayd: “Ibrahim passed by a\ndead whale, half of which was in the sea and half in the land.

Satan\nthe evil one whispered to him: ‘How is Allah going to gather the different parts of this from the bellies of all\nthese beasts?’ Ibrahim said: (My Lord!

Abu Nu‘aym al-Asfahani informed me, among that which he authorized me to narrate from\nhim> ‘Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Ja‘far> Muhammad ibn Sahl> Salamah ibn Shabib> Ibrahim ibn al-\nHakam ibn Aban> his father who said: “I was sitting with ‘Ikrimah at a seashore when he said: ‘those who\ndrown in the seas, the fish share their meat such that nothing remains of them except bones.

People will then come and use this dung to lit fire. When the\nfire is put out, the wind comes and scatters the ashes all over. When the Trumpet is blown, these people\nand the inhabitants of the graves will emerge together. This is what is meant by Allah’s saying (... and\nbehold them standing waiting!) [al-Zumar, 39:68]’ ”. Said Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Yasar: “When Ibrahim\nargued with Nimrod, he said: ‘My Lord is He who gives life and death. Nimrod said: ‘I also give life and\ndeath’. He killed a man and set another free and then said: ‘I have killed this one and given life to this one’.\nIbrahim said to him: ‘Well, Allah gives life by restoring the spirit to this dead body’. Nimrod said: ‘And did\nyou see that which you now say with your own eyes?’ He could not say: yes, I saw it! And so he moved on\nto another argument. Then he requested his Lord to show him how He brought the dead back to life so that\nhe may set his heart at ease upon argumentation, such that his argument would be based upon direct\nseeing and witnessing’ ”. Ibn ‘Abbas, Sa‘id ibn Jubayr and al-Suddi also said: “When Allah took Ibrahim as\nhis intimate friend, the angel of death took permission from his Lord to go and give Ibrahim this glad tiding.\nHe went to Ibrahim and said: ‘I came to give you the glad tiding that Allah, exalted is He, has taken you as\nan intimate friend’. Ibrahim praised Allah, glorious and majestic is He, and then said: ‘What is the sign of\nthis intimate friendship?’ The angel said: ‘Its sign is that Allah answers your supplication and brings the dead\nback to life by your request’. The angel then left. Ibrahim said: ‘My Lord! Show me how You give life to the\ndead’. Allah said: ‘Do you not believe?’ Ibrahim said: ‘I do, but I ask in order that my heart may be at ease,\nknowing that you answer my request when I request You and give me when I ask You, and that you have\nindeed taken me as an intimate friend’ ”.",

They said: “This refers to those who tie their horses for the\nsake of Allah, they spend on them by night and day, secretly and in the open.

When Allah, exalted is He, made His Messenger conquer Mecca, He abolished all\nusurious transactions. Banu ‘Amr ibn ‘Umayr and Banu’l-Mughirah, then, went to see ‘Attab ibn Usayd who\nwas in Mecca. Banu’l-Mughirah said: ‘Why are we the most wretched of all people? Usury has been cancelled\nfrom amongst people, but we still pay it’. The Banu ‘Amr ibn ‘Umayr said: ‘The treaty that we have stipulates\nthat usury is paid to us’. ‘Attab sent a letter to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,\nregarding this matter. Then this verse and the verse after it (And if ye do not, then be warned of war\n(against you) from Allah and His messenger...) were revealed. The Banu ‘Amr knew that they would not be\npaid usury when the result involves a war from Allah and His Messenger. Allah, exalted is He, says: (And if\nye repent, then ye have your principal (without interest)) such that you would not take more (Wrong not,\nand ye shall not be wronged) by being given less than your capital”. ‘Ata’ and ‘Ikrimah also said: “This verse\nwas revealed about al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib and ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan who had lent someone dates.\nWhen it was time for the collection of the dates, the owner of the dates said to them: ‘If you take all of what\nis due to you what remains will not be enough for me and my dependents. Why do you not take half of what\nis due to you and I will double the interest that was initially agreed?’ They both agreed. When the term was\ndue, they both asked the man to pay what was agreed. This reached the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\n\n\nand give him peace, and he warned them against going ahead with it. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed\nthis verse. Both ‘al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib and ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan complied and took back only the\ncapital they initially lent to the man. Said al-Suddi: “This verse was revealed about al-‘Abbas and Khalid ibn\nal-Walid who were partners in the pre-Islamic period. Both of them used to lend others money with usury.\nWhen Islam came, people owed huge sums of money to them because of usury. Allah, exalted is He, then\nrevealed this verse, and the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘Any usurious transaction\nagreed in the pre-Islamic period is cancelled and the first usury I cancel is that of al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-\nMuttalib’ ”.",

The commentators of the Qur’an said:\n“When the verse (and whether ye make known what is in your minds or hide, Allah will bring you to account\nfor it) was revealed, Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, Mu‘adh ibn Jabal and a group from the\nHelpers all went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace.

One of us\nspeaks to himself with things that he does not like to remain in his heart even in exchange for the world and\nall that it contains. And now we are taken to task for the things that we speak to our own selves. By Allah,\nwe are doomed’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘This is how it was\nrevealed!’ They said: ‘We are ruined; we have been bound by that which we cannot possibly bear’. The\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘Are you going to say as the Children of Israel\nsaid to Moses (We hear and we rebel!); say rather: We hear and we obey’.

Beware lest Allah inflicts on you\nthe like of that which he has inflicted on Quraysh on the day of Badr; embrace Islam before that which has\nbefallen them befalls you.

So Salman went up to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, who had on him a\nTurkish collar. He said: 'O Messenger of Allah! We came across a white rock of flint inside the ditch which\nhas broken our steel and proved very hard to break, for we did everything we could to break it but in vain.\nPlease tell us what to do, for we do not like going beyond the line you drew'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, went down to the ditch along with Salman while the remaining nine people\nremained at the verge of it. He took the axe from Salman and struck the rock with one mighty blow which\nsplit it into two, and a light shone from its two sides, such that it was like lighting a lamp in a dark room.\nThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, pronounced the Takbir which is usually\npronounced after a conquest and the Muslims did the same. Then he struck it again with a blow and a light\nshone from its two sides, such that it was like lighting a lamp in a dark room. The Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, pronounced the Takbir which is usually pronounced after a conquest and the\nMuslims did the same. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, struck it a third time\nupon which the rock broke into pieces and a light shone, such that it was like lighting a lamp in a dark room.\nThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, pronounced the Takbir which is usually\npronounced after a conquest and the Muslims did the same. He then held the hand of Salman and climbed\nup. Salman said: 'May my mother and father be your ransom, O Messenger of Allah, I saw something which\nI had never seen before'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, turned to the people\npresent and said: 'Did you see that which Salman is talking about?' They said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah!'\nHe said: 'I struck the first time and the light which you saw shone and through it I could see the palaces of\nal-Hirah and the cities of Chosroes resembling the teeth of dogs. Gabriel, peace be upon him, informed me\nthen that my nation will conquer them. Then I struck a second time and in that light I could see the red\npalaces of the land of Byzantium resembling the teeth of dogs. Gabriel, peace be upon him, informed me\nthen that my nation will conquer them. Then I struck the rock with my third blow and the light which you\nsaw shone and I saw the palaces of San'a' resembling the teeth of dogs. Gabriel, peace be upon him,\ninformed me then that my nation will conquer them. So receive the good news'. The Muslims were happy to\nhear the good news. They said: 'Praise be to Allah, it is a true promise; he has promised us victory after\ndigging the Trench'. But the hypocrites said: 'Are you not amazed that he is raising your hope for nothing\nand is promising you something which is clearly untrue. He informs you that he can see from Yathrib the\npalaces of al-Hira and the cities of Chosroes and that you will conquer them. All this while you are digging\nthis ditch because of fear and are unable to show yourselves'.

You are only\nresentfully envious!' And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”. Al-Kalbi also related from Abu Salih\nthat Ibn 'Abbas said - and the same is reported by 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Ghanm from the Companions of the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and this was also mentioned by Muhammad ibn\nIshaq ibn Yasar, such that the wordings of their narrations are mixed up with each other - : “When Ja'far ibn\nAbi Talib and his fellow companions migrated to Abyssinia and settled there and the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, migrated to Medina which was followed by the Battle of Badr, the\nQuraysh called for a meeting in Dar al-Nadwah and said: 'We have to exact revenge for those of us who\nwere killed at Badr from the Companions of Muhammad who are with the Negus. Collect, therefore, some\nmoney and gift it to the Negus and he will give you in exchange your people who are staying with him. For\nthis mission, select two of your men who are known for their good judgement'. And so they sent 'Amr ibn al-\n'As and 'Umarah ibn Abi Mu'ayt with gifts, tanned skins and other things. They sailed across the sea to\nAbyssinia. When they entered in on the Negus, they prostrated themselves and greeted him. They said: 'Our\npeople are grateful to you and want to give you sincere advice for they wish you good. They have sent us to\nyou to warn you about the people who came to you because they represent a liar who has emerged\namongst us, claiming he is Allah's Messenger. None of us, except fools, followed him. We had made it very\nhard on them and drove them away to the canyons of our land. No one was allowed to go to them, and\n\n\nnone of them was allowed to leave; they were destroyed by hunger and thirst. When things got tough, he\nsent you his cousin to corrupt your religion, kingdom and subjects. So beware of them and hand them over\nto us to suffice you their matter'. They also said to him: 'The proof for what we say is that they will not\nprostrate to you or greet you with the greeting with which people greet you, out of repulsion from your\nreligion and way of life'. The Negus summoned them, and when they came, Ja'far shouted at the door: 'The\nparty of Allah asks your permission to enter'. Upon hearing them, the Negus said: 'Order the crier to repeat\nwhat he said'. When Ja'far repeated what he said, the Negus said: 'Indeed, let them enter with Allah's\nassurance and safety'. 'Amr ibn al-'As looked at his companion and said: 'Do you not see how they refer\nunintelligently to the party of Allah?' They did not like at all what they had heard. The Companions entered\nbut did not prostrate themselves to the Negus. 'Amr ibn al-'As said: 'Do you not see how too proud they are\nto prostrate themselves before you?' The Negus asked them: 'What prevents you from prostrating\nyourselves before me and greeting me with the greeting with which I am greeted by people from all over\nthe world?' They said: 'We only prostrate ourselves to Allah Who created and made you king. What you\nmentioned was our salutation when we used to worship idols. Allah then sent among us a true Prophet who\ncommanded us to greet by means of a greeting which is pleasing to Allah, the greeting of peace, the\ngreeting of the inhabitants of Paradise'. The Negus knew that what he said was the truth and that it was\nmentioned in the Torah and the Gospel. He said: 'Who is the caller who was seeking permission for the party\nof Allah to enter?' Ja'far identified himself and then spoke. He said: 'You are a king among the kings of the\npeople of this earth, as you are of the people of the Book. Abundant talk and injustice will not do with you,\nand I would like to answer you on behalf of my companions. Command one of these men to speak and let\nthe other one listen so that you can hear our dialogue'. 'Amr said to Ja'far: 'You speak!' Ja'far said to the\nNegus: 'Ask this man: are we slaves or freemen? If we are runaway slaves, then by all means do return us\nto our masters'. The Negus asked: 'Are they slaves or freemen?' He said: 'They are respected freemen!' The\nNegus said: 'They have escaped from slavery'. Ja'far said: 'Ask them: have we shed any blood without any\nlegitimate right for retaliation to be exacted from us?' 'Amr said: 'They have not shed even a single drop of\nblood'. Ja'far added: 'Ask them: have we wrongfully taken the property of any people which we are now\nasked to give back?' The Negus said: 'O 'Amr! I will pay it back even if it is a kantar'. 'Amr said: 'They have\nnot taken even one kerat'. The Negus said: 'In that case, what do you want from them?' 'Amr said: 'We\nwere all following one religion, the religion of our forefathers, but they left that and followed a different\nreligion while we continue to follow it. Their people have therefore sent us so that you hand them over to\nus'. The Negus asked: 'What is the religion which you had previously followed and the one you are following\nnow? Tell me the truth!' Ja'far said: 'The religion which we used to follow and which we have now\nabandoned is the religion and matter of Satan; we used to disbelieve in Allah, glorious and majestic is He,\nand worship stones. As for the religion to which we have reverted, it is Allah's religion, Islam, which was\nbrought to us by a Messenger from Allah who also brought a Scripture like the Scripture brought by Jesus; in\nfact both Scriptures agree with one another'. The Negus said: 'O Ja'far! You have mentioned a very serious\nmatter; be deliberate!' The Negus then ordered that the bells be rang by which he summoned all his priests\nand monks. When they all gathered, he said: 'I implore you by Allah Who revealed the Gospel to Jesus: is\nthere any mention of a prophet sent by Allah in the interval between the advent of Jesus and the Day of\nJudgement?' They said: 'Yes, by Allah! Jesus has given the good news of his advent. He said: whoever\nbelieves in this prophet believes in him and whoever disbelieves in this prophet disbelieves in him'. The\nNegus turned to Ja'far and said: 'What does this man say, command and forbid you?' Ja'far said: 'He recites\nunto us the Book of Allah, enjoins good, forbids evil, commands good treatment of one's neighbours,\nkeeping ties with one's kin, showing goodness toward orphans and he also commands us to worship Allah\nalone without any associate'. The Negus said: 'Recite to us some of what he used to recite to you'. Ja'far\nrecited to Him Surah the Spider and Surah the Byzantines. The eyes of the Negus and those with him\n[among his subjects] overflowed with tears. They said: 'O Ja'far, give us more of this wholesome speech'.\nJa'far read Surah the Cave. At this point, 'Amr wanted to provoke the Negus. He said: 'They slander Jesus\nand his mother!' The Negus asked: 'What do they say about Jesus and his mother?' Ja'far read to them\nSurah Mary and when he recited the section which mentions Jesus and his mother, the Negus picked up a\nfragment from a tooth pick (Siwak) - so small that it could get into one's eye-and said: 'By Allah! Jesus did\nnot add to what you have said more than this [i.e. the fragment that he picked]'. He then turned toward\nJa'far and his companions and said: 'Go wherever you want in my land. You are safe. Whoever insults or\nharms you will face a penalty. Receive the good news and do not be afraid. Today, no harm shall ever befall\nthe party of Abraham'. 'Amr asked: 'And who are the party of Abraham?' He said: 'They are these people\nand the leader who sent them here as well as all those who follow them'. The idolaters denied this and\n\n\nclaimed that it was them who were following the religion of Abraham. The Negus returned the money that\n'Amr and his companion had gifted him, saying: 'Your gift is a bribe, so take it back. Allah has appointed me\nas a king and did not take a bribe from me'. Ja'far said: 'And we left. We lived in a good land with\nhonourable neighbours'. Allah, glorious and majestic is He, revealed to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, in Medina about their dispute regarding Abraham (Lo! those of mankind who have\nthe best claim to Abraham are those who followed him) i.e. those who follow his religion and way, (and this\nProphet) i.e. Muhammad, Allah bless him and give him peace, (and those who believe (with him) and Allah\nis the Protecting Guardian of the believers)”. Abu Hamid Ahmad ibn al-Hasan al-Warraq informed us> Abu\nAhmad Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Jazari> 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Hatim> Abu Sa'id al-Ashajj> Waki'>\nSufyan ibn Sa'id> his father> Abu'l-Duha> 'Abd Allah who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless\nhim and give peace, said: “Every prophet has supporters from among other prophets, and my support is my\nforefather and my Lord's intimate friend Abraham”. He then recited: (Lo! those of mankind who have the\nbest claim to Abraham are those who followed him, and this Prophet).",

As\na result of which, Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Lo! those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah’s\ncovenant and their oaths...). Said al-Kalbi: “Due to scarcity of foodstuff, some poor Jewish scholars went to\nseek help from Ka‘b ibn al-Ashraf in Medina. Ka‘b asked them: Is there anything in your Scripture which\nindicates that this man is Allah’s Messenger?’ They said: ‘Yes! Do you not find the same?’ He said: ‘No, I\ndon’t!’ They said: ‘Well, we bear witness that he is Allah’s servant and Messenger’. Ka‘b said: ‘Allah has\ndeprived you of much good, you came to me and I really wanted to be good to you and to clothe your\ndependents. But Allah has deprived you and deprived your dependents’. They said: ‘We only thought that he\nis the man. Give us some respite until we meet him’. They went and wrote down a description which was\ndifferent than that of the Prophet [Allah bless him and give him peace, as was in their Scripture]. After\nwhich they met the Prophet of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, spoke with him and asked him\nsome questions. They went back to Ka‘b and said: ‘We had thought that he was Allah’s Messenger but when\nwe met him we realised that he does not fit the description that we had and found that his description is\ndifferent’. They got out the new description which they wrote down and showed it to Ka‘b. Ka‘b was very\nhappy with them. He fed them and spent on them. Because of this Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”.\nSaid ‘Ikrimah: “This verse was revealed about Rafi‘ and Kinanah ibn Abu’l-Huqayq as well as Huyayy ibn\nAkhtab, and other Jewish chiefs. They had concealed Allah’s covenant with them in the Torah regarding\nMuhammad, Allah bless him and give him peace, which they had changed with their own hands and wrote\ninstead something different in order not to miss the gains and earning they procured from their followers”.",

Abu ‘Amr al-\nQantari informed me, among other things he gave me authorisation to relate from him> Muhammad ibn al-\nHusayn al-Haddadi> Muhammad ibn Yahya ibn Khalid> Ishaq ibn Ibrahim> al-Mu’ammil ibn Isma‘il>\nHammad ibn Yazid> Ayyub> ‘Ikrimah who said: “The two tribes of the Aws and Khazraj had fought each\nother in the pre-Islamic period and upon the advent of Islam, Allah, exalted is He, united their hearts and\nhad peace with each other. One day, a Jew sat in an assembly of mixed people which belonged to the Aws\nand Khazraj. He recited some poetry which was composed by one of the tribes during their war against each\nother. Something stirred within the people of the other tribe, and so they said: ‘Our poet has said this and\nthat about such-and-such a battle’. The others replied by saying: ‘And our poet has said this and that about\nsuch-and-such a battle’. Suddenly some of them said: ‘Let us start war all over again!’ Those who belonged\nto the tribe of Aws cried: ‘O people of Aws!’ and those who belonged to the tribe of Khazraj cried: ‘O people\nof Khazraj!’ They all gathered up, took up arms and aligned themselves ready for to engage in battle. At this\npoint, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, went and\nstood between the two armies, read this verse and raised his voice in the process. When they heard his\nvoice, they stopped talking and listened to him. When he finished his recitation, they all dropped their\nweapons and embraced one another, crying”. Said Zayd ibn Aslam: “Shas ibn Qays, the Jew, was an old\nman who grew up in the pre-Islamic period. He was a great disbeliever. His hate for the Muslims was\nextreme and his resentful envy toward them was intense. One day, he passed by a group of Companions of\nthe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, from the Aws and the Khazraj who were\ngathered in an assembly and talking, and was infuriated to see their unity, friendliness and reconciliation\nwhen they were enemies in the pre-Islamic period. He said: ‘The people of Banu Qaylah have united in this\nland. By Allah, we have no abode with them if they are united’. And so he instructed a youth who was with\nhim, saying: ‘Go and sit with them and then remind them of the event of Bu‘ath and what happened before\nit and recite to them some of the poetry which they used to compose against each other’. Bu‘ath was the\nday when the Aws fought against the Khazraj and the former emerged triumphant against the latter. The\nyoung man did as he was told which caused people to dispute with and boast to each other to the extent\nthat two men from the two tribes — Aws ibn Qaydhi of the Banu Harithah clan of Aws and Jabbar ibn Sakhr\nof the Banu Salamah clan of the Khazraj — exchanged words and one of them said to the other: ‘If you\nwish, by Allah, we will do it all over again’. Both camps got very angry and said: ‘It’s done! War is declared,\nand let us meet at al-Zahirah’, a volcanic area toward which they headed. The Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, heard of this and went straight to them accompanied by a group of Emigrants\nwho were with him. When he got there, he said: ‘O Muslims! You fight because of the call of pagan\nignorance, even though I am still in your midst, and Allah has honoured you with Islam by means of which\nhe severed from you the whole matter of pagan ignorance and united your hearts. Will you then revert to\nthat which you used to do when you were disbelievers? Allah! Allah!’ People realised straightaway that what\nthey were about to do was of Satan’s incitement and of the plotting of their enemies. They dropped their\nweapons, wept and embraced each other, and then left the scene with the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, submissive and compliant. Allah, glorious and majestic is He, then revealed (O ye\nwho believe!) meaning the Aws and the Khazraj (If ye obey a party of those who have received the\nScripture) i.e. Shas and his followers (they will make you disbelievers after your belief)”. Said Jabir ibn ‘Abd\nAllah: “No one who had ever shown himself to us was more disliked than the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace. He gestured to us with his hand and we stopped and Allah, exalted is He,\nreconciled us. Then no one was more beloved to us than the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace. Never have I seen a day whose start was so ugly and monstrous and whose end was as good as\nthat particular day”.",

This was narrated by Bukhari through the channel of\nal-Zuhri from Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab, and the full report is better than this. The judge Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn al-\nHasan informed us> Abu'l-'Abbas Muhammad ibn Ya'qub> Bahr ibn Nasr> Ibn Wahb> Yunus ibn Yazid> Ibn\nShihab> Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab and Abu Salamah ibn 'Abd al-Rahman> Abu Hurayrah who said: “After\nfinishing his recitation, bowing and then standing upright, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, used to say: 'Allah hears whoever praises Him and our Lord all praise belongs to You', then he\nwould say while still standing in prayer: 'O Allah! Save al-Walid ibn al-Walid, Salamah ibn Hisham, 'Ayyash\nibn Abi Rabi'ah and the downtrodden believers. O Allah! Tighten Your grip on Mudar, and make their years\nlike the years of Joseph. O Allah! Curse Lihyan, Ri'l and Dhakwan as well as 'Usayyah, they disobeyed Allah\nand His Messenger'. But then we heard that he stopped making this supplication when this verse was\nrevealed (It is no concern at all of thee (Muhammad) whether He relent toward them or punish them; for\nthey are evil-doers)”. This was narrated by Bukhari from Musa ibn Isma'il from Ibrahim ibn Sa'd from al-\nZuhri.",

The\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, went out one day to one of his military expeditions\nand the man from Thaqif accompanied him, leaving his wife and business under the care of the Helper who\nused to look after the family of the man from Thaqif. One day he saw the wife of his friend who had just\nfinished having a bath, with her hair spread, and he fell for her. He entered in on her without asking\npermission and leaned to kiss her but she put her hand on her face such that he kissed the outside of her\nhand. But then he regretted what he had done, felt the shame of his action and retreated. Upon his retreat,\nhis friend's wife exclaimed: 'Glory be to Allah! You have betrayed your trust, disobeyed your Lord and failed\nto get what you desired!' Regretting his action, the man went wandering in the mountains, to repent to\nAllah, exalted is He, from his action. When the man from Thaqif returned to his family, she informed him of\nwhat had happened. He went out looking for his friend until somebody told him where to find him. He found\nhim in prostration, saying: 'My Lord, my sin! My sin! I have betrayed my brother!' His friend said: 'O so-and-\nso come let us go to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and ask him about your\nsin, haply Allah will ease your situation and relent on you'. And so he went back with him until they reached\nMedina one day, at the time of 'Asr prayer and Gabriel, peace be upon him, brought down the news of the\nacceptance of his repentance. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, recited to him\n(And those who, when they do an evil thing) up to His saying (a bountiful reward for workers!). When he\nfinished 'Umar [ibn al-Khattab] asked: ''O Messenger of Allah! This applies specifically to him or is it to all\npeople?' The Messenger said: 'No, it applies to all' ”.

When one of them\ncommitted a sin, he found the following morning, written on his door step, what he should do to expiate his\nsin, 'cut off your nose', 'cut off your ear', 'do this or do that'. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, did not respond. But then this verse was revealed (And those who, when they do an evil thing) upon\nwhich the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'Shall I not inform you of that which is better\nthan all of that', and he recited this verse”.",

This assembly included a mixture of Muslims, Jews and idolaters, the worshippers of idols. 'Abd Allah\nibn Rawahah was also in this assembly. When the cloud of dust, stirred by the movement of the beast,\nreached the assembly, 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy covered his nose with his cloak and said: “Do not cover us with\ndust”. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, greeted them with the greeting of peace,\nstopped and climbed down his mount. He called them to Allah and recited to them some of the Qur'an. Then\n'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy said: “O man, there is nothing more beautiful than what you had just said. And if it is\ntrue, we ask you not to annoy us in these assemblies of ours. Go back to your camp, and if somebody\ncomes to you, then relate it to him”. 'Abd Allah ibn Rawahah then said: “No, indeed, come and tell us about\nit in our own assemblies for we love it”. The Muslims, idolaters and Jews then started to throw insults at\neach others until they were on the verge of assaulting one another. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, kept calming them until they stopped. He then mounted his beast and headed toward Sa'd ibn\n'Ubadah. When he entered in on him, he said: “O Sa'd, did you not hear what Abu Hubab (he meant 'Abd\nAllah ibn Ubayy) said. He said this and that”. Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah said: “O Messenger of Allah, forgive him. For\nby Him Who has revealed the Scripture, Allah has brought the truth which he revealed to you, and the\npeople of this city had reconciled and come together to support it as one solid bloc. And so when Allah has\ndriven away the enmity which existed between people by means of the truth which He bestowed upon you,\nhis authority waned and this is why he said what he said”.

Ibn 'Abbas replied: 'From whence did you get such an\nunderstanding?

They\nexpected him to praise them for informing him about that which he asked them and exulted in their act of\nconcealing that matter'. Ibn 'Abbas then recited (And (remember) when Allah laid a charge on those who\nhad received the Scripture (He said) Ye are to expound it to mankind...) [Al 'Imran, 3:187]”. This was\nnarrated by Bukhari> Ibrahim ibn Musa> Hisham and also by Muslim> Zuhayr ibn Harb> Hajjaj; both Hajjaj\nand Hisham narrated it from Ibn Jurayj.

Hence, they were unanimous in their\ndisbelief in Muhammad, Allah bless him and give him peace, and the Qur'an and they exulted in this fact.\nThey said: ''Praise be to Allah Who has united us and made it so we did not differ or leave our religion'. They\nalso said: 'We are the people of fasting and prayer as well as the friends of Allah'. This is why Allah, exalted\n\n\nis He, said (who exult in what they have given) i.e. in what they did (and love to be praised for what they\nhave not done) i.e. for that which they had mentioned of fasting, prayer and worship”.",

It is not lawful for you forcibly to inherit the\nwomen (of your deceased kinsmen): “It was the habit that, when a man died, his heirs had a better right to\nhis wife, if one of them wished he would marry her, if not they married her off to somebody else or,\nalternately, leave her unmarried, for they had a better right to her than her own family. This verse was\nrevealed about this issue”. This was related by Bukhari in the chapter on Tafsir from Muhammad ibn Muqatil\n\n\nand he also related it in the chapter on Coercion from Husayn ibn Mansur and both his narrators related it\nfrom Asbat. The commentators of the Qur’an said: “In the pre-Islamic and beginning of the Islamic eras, if a\nman died and was survived by his wife, it was the custom that his son from another wife or his relative from\nhis clan would come and throw his cloak on that woman, and this gesture entailed that he had a better right\nover her than she had on her own person or that anyone else had on her. If he then wished to marry her,\nhe married her without giving her any dowry, except for the dowry which was given to her by her deceased\nhusband. Alternately, he could marry her to someone else and take all her dowry, giving her nothing in\nexchange. Or, he could leave her unmarried to hurt her so that she would buy herself from him in exchange\nfor what she inherited from her deceased husband, or wait until she died so that he inherits her. When Abu\nQays ibn al-Aslat al-Ansari died, he was survived by his wife Kubayshah bint Ma‘an al-Ansariyyah. One of his\nsons, from another wife, by the name of Hisn (Muqatil stated that his name was Qays ibn Abi Qays) placed\nhis cloak on her and, thus, inherited the right to her marriage. But then he left her untouched and failed to\nprovide for her. He did this to hurt her in order to drive her to buy herself from him with her money. This led\nKubayshah to go to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. She said to him: ‘O\nMessenger of Allah! Abu Qays has died and his son has inherited the right to marry me. But he has harmed\nme and is taking his time. He has failed to provide for me, to consummate the marriage or to let me go\nfree’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to her: ‘Remain in your home until\nAllah reveals something about your matter’. When she left and the women of Medina heard of this, they\nwent to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: ‘We are in the same situation\nas Kubayshah except that it is the cousins who had married us instead of the sons’. Allah, exalted is He,\nthen revealed this verse”.",

This was narrated by Bukhari from Sadaqah ibn al-Fadl and also by Muslim from Zuhayr ibn\nHarb and both transmitter related it from Hajjaj. Said Ibn ‘Abbas, according to the narration of Badhan: “The\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent Khalid ibn al-Walid in a military expedition to\none of the Arab clans. He was accompanied in this expedition by ‘Ammar ibn Yasir. When he drew closer to\nthem at night, he stopped to camp in order to try to conquer them the following morning. Meanwhile this\nclan was warned about the approaching military expedition which made them flee the area, except for one\nman who was a Muslim. This man asked his family to get ready to move and then he went to the camp of\nKhalid and entered in on ‘Ammar. He said to him: ‘O Abu’l-Yaqzan! I am one of you. But my people ran\naway when they heard you were coming. I stayed because I am Muslim. Is this of any benefit to me, or shall\nI flee as my people did?’ ‘Ammar said: ‘Stay, for it is beneficial to you’. The man returned to his family and\ntold them to stay. The following morning, Khalid invaded the clan but found no one except this man, and so\nhe imprisoned him and seized his property. ‘Ammar went to him and said: ‘Let the man go, for he is a\nMuslim and I have already given him amnesty and told him to stay’. Khalid said: ‘You give protection from\nme to others while I am the leader!’ Ammar said: ‘Yes, I give protection from you to others while you are\n\n\nthe leader’. And they exchanged angry words. Then they both went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, and informed him about the man. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, gave the\nman amnesty, sanctioned the amnesty that ‘Ammar had given to the man and then forbade him from giving\namnesty to anyone in the future without the express permission of his leader. ‘Ammar and Khalid insulted\neach other in the presence of Allah’s Messenger, Allah bless him and give him peace, and when ‘Ammar\nspoke very rudely to Khalid, the latter became very angry and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, will you allow this\nslave to insult me? By Allah, if it were not for you, he would not insult me’. ‘Ammar, by the way, was a client\nof Hashim ibn al-Mughirah. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘O Khalid,\nleave ‘Ammar alone, for whoever insults ‘Ammar, Allah will insult him, and whoever hates ‘Ammar, Allah will\nhate him’. Upon which ‘Ammar left. Khalid followed him, and held him by his cloak and asked him to forgive\nhim, which he did. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse, enjoining obedience to those who are in\nauthority”.",

The Jew\nran away. This verse was then revealed. Gabriel, peace be upon him, said: “'Umar has differentiated\n\n\nbetween the truth and falsehood”, and so he was named al-Faruq [the distinguisher]. Said al-Suddi: “Some\nJewish people had embraced Islam while others were mere hypocrites. In the pre-Islamic period the custom\nbetween the clans of Qurayzah and al-Nadir was that if a man from Banu Qurayzah killed another from\nBanu'l-Nadir, the killer was killed in retaliation and a hundred wasq [pl. Awsuq; one wasq = 60 sa'] of dates\nwere paid in surplus as blood money. But when a man from Banu'l-Nadir killed another from Banu Qurayzah,\nthe killer was not killed in retaliation and only sixty wasq of dates were paid as blood money. Banu'l-Nadir\nwere the allies of the Aws. They were larger and their pedigree nobler than that of Banu Qurayzah who were\nthe allies of the Khazraj. Then it happened that a man from the Banu'l-Nadir killed another from Banu\nQurayzah and a dispute ensued because of this. Banu'l-Nadir said: 'We had an agreement in the pre-Islamic\nperiod that retaliation is exacted from you but not from us and that your blood money is sixty wasq while\nthe blood money due to us is one hundred wasq. And so we will give you your due'. The Khazraj said: 'This\nis something you did in the pre-Islamic period because you were greater in number and we were few.\nToday, we are brothers and our religion is the same as yours. You do not have any merit over us'. The\nhypocrites said: ''Let us go to Abu Burdah al-Aslami, the soothsayer, to judge between us. The Muslims said:\n'No, but rather let us go to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace'. The hypocrites refused and\nwent instead to Abu Burdah to judge between them. Abu Burdah said to them: 'Increase the bribe!' They\nsaid: 'We will give you ten awsuq!' He said: 'I will take a hundred as my blood money, for I fear if I judge in\nfavour of the man from Banu'l-Nadir, Banu Qurayzah will kill me; and if I judge in favour of the man from\nBanu Qurayzah, Banu'l-Nadir will kill me'. When they refused to give him more than ten awsuq, he refused\nto judge between them. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this verse and the Prophet, Allah bless him and\ngive him peace, called the soothsayer of Aslam to embrace Islam. He refused to do so and left. The Prophet,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, said to the two sons of the soothsayer: 'Go after your father, for if he\ngoes beyond such-and-such limit he will never accept Islam'. They caught up with him and kept persuading\nhim until he went back and embraced Islam. The Prophet, Allah, bless him and give him peace, commanded\na crier to go round and cry: 'The soothsayer of Aslam has embraced Islam' ”.",

He fled to Medina and took refuge in one of its fortresses. His mother\nwas distressed a great deal. She said to her two sons Abu Jahl and al-Harith ibn Hisham, who were his half\nbrothers from his mother’s side: ‘By Allah, I will stay outside in the sun, not eating or drinking, until you\nbring him back to me’. And they went looking for him, accompanied by al-Harith ibn Zayd ibn Abi Anisah,\nuntil they reached Medina. They went to ‘Ayyash in his fortress, and said to him: ‘Come down, your mother\nhas not entered the confines of a house since you left. She has also sworn that she will not eat or drink until\nyou go back to her. By Allah we give you assurance that we will not coerce you to do anything nor will we\ncome between you and your religion’. When they mentioned his mother’s distress and gave him their\nassurance, he came down to them. They took him out of Medina, tied him up with strings and whipped him\na hundred lashes each, and then took him to his mother. His mother said to him: ‘I will not untie your fetters\nuntil you disbelieve in that which you have believed’, and he was left fettered in the sun until he gave them\nsome of what they had wanted. Al-Harith ibn Yazid went to him and said: ‘O ‘Ayyash, by Allah, if that which\n\n\nyou followed was guidance, you have now left it, and if it was error, you were already in error’. ‘Ayyash got\nvery angry because of what al-Harith said to him and this prompted him to say to him: ‘By Allah, I will kill\nyou if I find you alone’. Afterwards, ‘Ayyash embraced Islam and migrated to the Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, in Medina. Al-Harith ibn Yazid also embraced Islam and migrated to Medina.\nThis happened at a time when ‘Ayyash was not present. As such, he was unaware of al-Harith becoming\nMuslim. As he was walking outside Quba’, he met al-Harith ibn Yazid. When he saw him, he attacked and\nkilled him. People said to him: ‘What on earth have you done? He had become Muslim!’ ‘Ayyash went back\nto the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, you know\nwhat happened between me and al-Harith; I was unaware of his acceptance of Islam and I killed him’. And\nso Gabriel, peace be upon him, came down with the words of Allah, exalted is He, (It is not for a believer to\nkill a believer unless (it be) by mistake...)”.",

Said al-Hasan: “The Companions of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, went out in a reconnaissance patrol. While they were there, they met with some idolaters whom\nthey fought and defeated. One of the men ran away and a Muslim man followed him, in pursuit of his stuff.\nWhen he was about to strike him with his sword, the man said: 'I am a Muslim, I am a Muslim!' The Muslim\nman did not believe him. He killed him and took his possessions which were paltry. The Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, was informed of this. He said to the man: 'You killed him even though\nhe claimed he was Muslim!' The man said: 'O Messenger of Allah, he said it only to protect himself'. The\nMessenger said: 'Why did you not split his heart open?' 'Why, O Messenger of Allah', asked the man. He\nsaid: 'So that we see whether he was truthful or not'. The man said: 'How was I supposed to know he was\ntelling the truth, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'You did not know that but he expressed it with his words'.\nThis killer did not live long after this event.

I said: He said it only to\nprotect himself'. He said: 'What will you do when he comes on the Day of Judgement to dispute with you by\nmeans of 'there is no god but Allah''. And he kept repeating: 'You killed a man who says: there is no god but\nAllah', until I wished that I had only embraced Islam on that day. Then the verse (O ye who believe! When\nye go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah, be careful to discriminate) was revealed”. Al-Kalbi and Qatadah\nalso reported something of this effect. The authenticity of this tradition is evidenced by the following\ntradition. Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Farisi informed us> Muhammad ibn 'Isa ibn 'Amrawayh>\nIbrahim ibn Sufyan> Muslim> Ya'qub al-Dawraqi> Hushaym> Ibn Hasin> Abu Zubyan> Usamah ibn Zayd\nibn Harithah relating the following: “The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent us to al-Hirqah\nclose by Juhaynah. We raided them in the morning and defeated them. I and one of the Helpers chased one\nof their men and when we caught up with him, he said: there is no god but Allah. The Helper stopped but I\nstabbed him with my spear and killed him. When we went back the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, he heard of what had happened. He said to me: 'O Usamah, you killed him after he said, there is no\ngod but Allah'. I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, he said it to protect himself'. He said: 'You killed him after he\nsaid, there is no god but Allah', and he kept repeating it until I wished that I had embraced Islam only that\nday”.",

And so they\nfilled their containers with sand. They went to Abraham, peace be upon him, while Sarah was asleep and\ninformed him. Abraham, peace be upon him, was worried for the people. Sleep then overcame him. When\nSarah woke up, she proceeded to those containers and, upon opening them, she found white ground wheat\nof the best quality. She ordered the bakers to bake bread and people were fed. When Abraham, peace be\nupon him, woke up, he smelt the odour of food, and he asked: 'O Sarah, where did you get this food?'

This was narrated by al-Hakim Abu ‘Abd Allah in his\nSahih> Abu Bakr ibn Balawayh> Muhammad ibn Shadhan> Mu‘alla ibn Mansur> Ibn Abi Za’idah. The\ncommentators of the Qur’an said in explanation of this story: “Said Abu Rafi‘: ‘Gabriel, peace be upon him,\nwent to see the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, but did not enter in on the Prophet even\nthough he was granted permission to enter. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,\ncame out and said to him: ‘We have given you permission to enter, O Gabriel!’ He said: ‘Yes, you have, O\nMessenger of Allah, except that we do not enter a house where there is a picture or a dog’. They looked\naround and found that there was a puppy in one of the rooms’. Abu Rafi‘ said: ‘The Prophet, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, commanded me to kill every dog in Medina. I proceeded with the execution of the\ncommand until I reached al-‘Awali where I found a woman who kept a dog for her protection. Out of\ncompassion for her, I did not kill her dog. I went back to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace,\nand informed him of what had happened, and he commanded me to go back and kill it. I went back and\nkilled it. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded the killing of dogs, a\ngroup of people went to him and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, What is lawful for us of this community that\nwe have been commanded to kill?’ The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, did not\nanswer, and then Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. When this verse was revealed the Messenger of\nAllah, Allah bless him and give him peace, allowed keeping dogs which can be benefited from and warned\nagainst keeping dogs from which no benefit is derived. He also commanded the killing of rabid dogs,\n\n\nrapacious dogs and dogs that hurt and harm people. Apart from these, all other dogs were exempted from\nkilling’ ”. Sa‘id ibn Jubayr said: “This verse was revealed about ‘Adiyy ibn Hatim and Zayd ibn al-Muhalhil\n(the same Zayd al-Khayl [Zayd of the horses] whom the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, renamed Zayd al-Khayr [Zayd of goodness]), both of whom were from the tribe of Tayy. These two\nmen went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah,\nwe are people who hunt using dogs and falcons, and the dogs of the family of Dhurayh and those of the\nfamily of Abu Juwayriyah hunt cows, wild asses, deer and lizards, some of which we slaughter before they\nare killed and some are killed before we get to slaughter them. What is lawful for us in this case since, Allah,\nexalted is He, has forbidden eating the flesh of dead animals?’ And so this verse was revealed: (They ask\nthee (O Muhammad) what is made lawful for them. Say: (all) good things are made lawful for you), meaning\nthat which has been slaughtered (And those beasts and birds of prey), meaning the game hunted by trained\npredatory animals which are here hunting dogs and birds of prey”.",

The man took the sword out of its scabbard, moved it about but whenever\nhe was on the point of striking the Prophet with it, Allah, glorious and majestic is He, restrained him. The\nman then said: “O Muhammad, are you not scared of me?” “No!” answered the Prophet. The man said: “You\nare not scared of me even though the sword is in my hand?” The Prophet said: “Allah will protect me from\nyou”. The man put the sword back in its scabbard and gave it back to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, upon which Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Remember Allah’s favour unto you, how\na people were minded to stretch out their hands against you...). Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Tha‘labi informed us>\n‘Abd Allah ibn Hamid> Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan> Muhammad ibn Yahya> ‘Abd al-Razzaq>\nMa‘mar> al-Zuhri> Abu Salamah> Jabir who reported that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, stopped by at a certain location and so people spread about to seek shade under the trees. The\nProphet, Allah bless him and give him peace, hang his weapon on a tree and sat down to rest. A Bedouin\ncame along, got hold of the sword belonging to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,\nturned to him and said: “Who will save you from me now?” The Prophet said: “Allah!” The Bedouin repeated\nthe same question two or three times, and the answer of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace,\nwas always the same: “Allah!” The Bedouin then put the sword back in its scabbard. The Prophet, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, called his Companions and informed them of what happened while the\nBedouin, who went unpunished, was still sitting next to him. Mujahid, al-Kalbi and ‘Ikrimah said: “One of the\nCompanions of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, killed two men from Banu Salim at a period\nwhen the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, had a truce with Banu Salim. The next-of-kin of the\ntwo men went to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, to ask for blood money. The prophet,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, took Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘Ali, Talhah and ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn\n‘Awf and went to Ka‘b al-Ashraf, to seek help from Banu’l-Nadir to pay the blood money. They said: ‘Indeed\nAbu’l-Qasim, it is high time for you to come and ask us to help you. Sit down so that we feed you and fulfil\nyour request’. When the Prophet and his Companions sat down, they gathered close by and said to each\nother: ‘Muhammad will never be as close to you as he is now; who can climb up to the top of the house,\nthrow a rock on him and rid us of him?’ ‘Umar ibn Jihash ibn Ka‘b said: ‘I will do it!’ He got hold of a huge\nmillstone intending to throw it on the Prophet, but Allah, exalted is He, prevented him from doing so. When\nGabriel informed the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, of what happened, the Messenger of\nAllah, Allah bless him and give him peace, left that house, and Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”.",

He\nthen summoned one of their doctors and asked him: 'I implore you by Allah who has sent the Torah to\nMoses, is this what your Scripture decrees as punishment for the adulterer'. He said: 'No! And if you had not\nimplored me by Allah, I would not tell you. Our Scripture rules that the punishment of the adulterer is\nstoning. But it became widespread among our notables. Initially, when one of the notables committed\nadultery, we left him unpunished while we applied stoning on the communality in cases of adultery. Then we\ndecided to look for a punishment that was applied on both the notables and communality of people. And so\nwe agreed on darkening the face with coal and flogging to replace stoning'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, said: 'O Allah! I am the first to reapply your command after they had\nsuspended it'. And he ordered that the Jewish man be stoned. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (O\nMessenger! Let not them grieve thee who vie one with another in the race to disbelief) up to His words (If\nthis be given unto you, receive it...), they said: 'Go to Muhammad; if he directs you to flog the adulterer and\ndarken his face with coal and apply flogging, then follow him. But do not follow him if he directs you to\napply stoning on him'. Up to His words (Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are\ndisbelievers)",

They agreed to fast the day and stand in\nprayer at night, never to sleep in their beds, eat meat or fat, never to sleep with their wives or use perfume.\nThey also agreed to wear coarse wool garments, reject the worldly life, wander through the land and\nbecome monks, and cut off their male organs. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, heard of this, he gathered them and said: 'I was informed that you agreed to do such-and-such\nthings, is this true?' They said: 'It is, but we only meant to do good'. He said to them: 'I was not\ncommanded to do those things, and your own selves have a right over you. Fast and break fast, stand in\nprayer at night and sleep, for I stand in prayer at night but I also sleep; I sometimes fast and sometimes do\nnot; I eat meat and fat. And whoever shuns my practice is not of me'. Then he went out and gave a sermon\nto people in which he said: 'How come some people have forbidden sleeping with women, eating, wearing\nperfume, sleeping and the desires of this world? I am not commanding you to be priests or monks, for there\nis no room in my religion for abstention from eating meat and sleeping with women, nor is there room for\nadoption of monasteries. The wandering of my community consists of fasting and its monasticism is Jihad.\nAnd worship Allah and do not associate anyone with Him; perform the greater and lesser pilgrimage,\nestablish the prayer, pay the poor-due, and fast the month of Ramadan. Those who were before you\nperished because of their extremism; they made things hard on themselves and so Allah made it hard on\nthem. The remains of those people are in monasteries and cloisters'. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed this\nverse, upon which they said: 'O Messenger of Allah, What is to be done with the vows that we have made?'\nThis is because they had vowed to each other to carry out the things they agreed on. As an answer, Allah,\nexalted is He, revealed (Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths)",

He taught us the Qur'an and\ngoodness and instilled fear in us through the mention of hellfire and the Garden and also through that which\nbenefits us and by means of mention of death and the Resurrection. One day, al-Aqra' ibn Habis al-Tamimi\nand 'Uyaynah ibn Hisn al-Fazari came to the Prophet and said: 'We are among the nobles of our people and\nwe dislike that we be seen with them, so could you repel them when we sit with you?' The Prophet, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, agreed, but they said: 'We will not be pleased until you write an agreement\nbetween us'.

Abu Talib said to him: ‘These are your people and cousins!’ The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, asked them: ‘What do you want?’ They said: ‘We want you to leave us alone with\nour idols and we will leave you alone with your Allah’. Abu Talib said: ‘Your people are being fair with you,\nso give your consent’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘If I agree to this\nwould you agree to give me one sentence, if you were to utter it, you would rule over the Arabs and non-\nArabs alike?’ Abu Jahl said: ‘Yes, by your father, we will give it to you and also give you ten other things like\nit; but what is it? He said: ‘Say: there is no god but Allah!’ They refused and expressed their aversion at this\nproposal, upon which Abu Talib said; ‘Son of my brother, ask for something else, for your people are wary of\nthis’. He said: ‘O uncle, I am not one who would ask for other than that. If they were to place the sun in my\nhand, I would not ask for anything other than that’. The chiefs of Quraysh said: ‘You would better stop\nreviling our idols or we will revile you and revile He Who commands you’. And so Allah, exalted is He,\nrevealed this verse”.",

In that occasion he threw the handful of dust and said: “Let the faces be distorted”, and\nsome of this dust went into the eyes of every single idolater.

The\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, threw that dust and we were defeated. Hence the\nwords of Allah, exalted is He (And thou (Muhammad) threwest not when thou didst throw, but Allah threw)”.",

Abu Lubabah was loyal to them, for his property, wife and\nchildren were with them. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent him to\nthem, they said to him: “O Abu Lubabah, what do you think we should do? Should we accept the judgment\nof Sa‘d ibn Mu‘adh?” Abu Lubabah made a gesture to his throat, i.e. that they should not do it, for they will\nbe slaughtered. Abu Lubabah said: “I straightaway realised that I had betrayed Allah and His Messenger”.\nAnd then this verse was revealed about him. When the verse was revealed, Abu Lubabah tied himself to one\nof the columns of the mosques and said: “By Allah, I will not taste food or drink until Allah relents on me or\nI die”. He remained in this state for seven days, neither eating nor drinking, until Allah, exalted is He,\nrelented on him. When it was said to him: “O Abu Lubabah!

The\nProphet went and untied him with his own hands.

Reporting from his\nsources, Muhammad ibn Ishaq said: “When the Quraysh returned to Mecca after their defeat at Badr and\nAbu Sufyan returned unharmed with their caravan, a group of men from the Quraysh whose fathers, sons\nand brothers were killed at this battle, including 'Abd Allah ibn Abi Rabi'ah, 'Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl, Safwan ibn\nUmayyah, went to see Abu Sufyan and those who had a share in that caravan and said to them: 'O men of\nQuraysh, Muhammad has harmed you and killed the best among you, so help us with this property which\nescaped unscathed that haply we may take revenge on him for what was inflicted on us'. They did and Allah,\nexalted is He, revealed this verse”.",

And haply Allah will guide them to Islam\nand be a support to us'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, then asked: 'What do\nyou think, O son of al-Khattab?' He said: 'By Allah, I do not agree with Abu Bakr.

The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, liked what Abu Bakr said and disliked\nwhat I said. And so, he accepted a ransom from them. The following day, 'Umar said: I went to see the\nProphet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and found him sitting with Abu Bakr. They were both crying. I\nsaid: 'O Messenger of Allah, what is it that makes you and your companion weep? If I can cry, I will cry with\nyou, if not I will feign crying'. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: “I am crying because\nof the suggestion of ransoming the prisoners which your fellow believers advised me to do.

Ibn Sirin and Murrah al-Hamadani said: “'Ali [ibn Abi\nTalib] said to al-'Abbas [ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib]: 'Are you not going to migrate to join the Prophet, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace?' al-'Abbas said: 'Am I not doing something much better than migration? Do I not\nquench the thirst of the pilgrims to the House of Allah and tend to the Sacred Mosque?' And so, this verse\nwas revealed as were revealed Allah's words (Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with\ntheir wealth and their lives...)",

This is because when the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, was preparing for the Battle of Tabuk, he said to him: “O Abu Wahb, would you not like to have\nscores of Byzantine women and men as concubines and servants?” He said: “O Messenger of Allah, my\npeople know that I am very fond of women and, if I see the women of the Byzantines, I fear I will not be\nable to hold back. So do not tempt me by them, and allow me not to join and, instead, I will assist you with\nmy wealth”. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, turned away from him and said: “I allow you”,\nand so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. When this verse was revealed, the Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, asked Banu Salamah, the tribe of al-Jadd: “Who is your master, O Banu\nSalamah?” They said: “Al-Jadd ibn Qays except that he is a miser and a coward”. The Prophet, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, responded: “Is there any sickness worse than miserliness? Rather, your master is\nthe fair, curly-haired youth: Bishr ibn al-Bara' ibn Ma'rur”. Hasan ibn Thabit composed about him the\nfollowing lines: And the Messenger of Allah said and truth catches up With him about whom he said: who do\nyou consider as your master. We said: Jadd ibn Qays even though We consider him a miser and a\ntroublesome one. He said: what is worse than that With which you reproach Jadd and which make a hand\nneedy. And he appointed Bishr ibn al-Bara' as chief for his magnanimity And it is befitting that Bishr who\nanswers others' call be appointed as chief. When a delegation comes to him, he spends his wealth And says:\ntake it for tomorrow it will return. The verses after this one verse and up to Allah's words (The alms are only\nfor the poor and the needy)",

When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, returned from the battle, he\npassed by them and asked about who they were. He was told: 'These are the people who failed to join you.\nThey vowed to remain in their position until you untie them yourself'. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, said: 'And I swear that I will not set them free until I am commanded to do so nor will I pardon\nthem unless it is Allah Who pardons them first. They have failed to join me and shunned fighting alongside\nthe Muslims'. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse. When it was revealed, the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, sent for them, freed them and pardoned them. When they were freed,\nthey said: 'O Messenger of Allah, these are our riches which caused us to fail to join you, spend them on\ncharity on our behalves to purify us and ask forgiveness for us'. He said: 'I was not commanded to take\nanything from your riches'. Allah, glorious and majestic is He, then revealed (Take alms of their wealth,\nwherewith thou mayst purify them and mayst make them grow...)",

The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded him to spread it among\nthe received alms.

This Abu 'Amir had embraced Christianity and became a\nmonk in the pre-Islamic period. But when the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,\nmoved to Medina, Abu 'Amir rejected the religion of Islam and showed enmity toward it. The Prophet, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, called him then Abu 'Amir al-Fasiq (the corrupt) [instead of Abu 'Amir al-\nRahib (the monk)]. Abu 'Amir left to Syria and then sent a letter to the hypocrites in which he wrote:\n'Prepare yourselves and make ready whatever you can of force and weapons. Built a mosque for me, for I\nam going to the Caesar to request him to send with me Byzantine soldiers so that I drive out Muhammad\nand his Companions'. And so, they built for him a mosque by the Quba' mosque. Those who built this\nmosque were 12 men: Khidham ibn Khalid (this mosque of opposition was an extension of his house),\nTha'labah ibn Hatib, Mu'attib ibn Qushayr, Abu Habibah ibn al-Az'ar, 'Abbad ibn Hunayf, Jariyah ibn 'Amir,\nhis two sons Majma' and Zayd, Nabtal ibn Harith, Bahzaj ibn 'Uthman, Bijad ibn 'Uthman and Wadi'ah ibn\nThabit.

He called for his gown, intending to wear it and\ngo with them when the Qur'an was revealed to him and Allah, glorious and majestic is He, informed him\nabout the mosque of opposition and what they were about to do. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, called Malik ibn al-Dukhshum, Ma'n ibn 'Adiyy, 'Amir ibn al-Sakan and Wahshiyy, the\nkiller of Hamzah and said to them: 'Go to this mosque whose builders have transgressed, destroy it and burn\nit down'. Malik proceeded with enflamed palm leaves, entered the mosque while its people were inside it,\nburnt it down and destroyed it. Its people dispersed [to avoid being burnt]. Then the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, commanded that that place be used as a garbage spot where carrion,\ndirt and refuse are thrown”.

This Abu 'Amir had embraced Christianity and became a\nmonk in the pre-Islamic period. But when the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,\nmoved to Medina, Abu 'Amir rejected the religion of Islam and showed enmity toward it. The Prophet, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, called him then Abu 'Amir al-Fasiq (the corrupt) [instead of Abu 'Amir al-\nRahib (the monk)]. Abu 'Amir left to Syria and then sent a letter to the hypocrites in which he wrote:\n'Prepare yourselves and make ready whatever you can of force and weapons. Built a mosque for me, for I\nam going to the Caesar to request him to send with me Byzantine soldiers so that I drive out Muhammad\nand his Companions'. And so, they built for him a mosque by the Quba' mosque. Those who built this\nmosque were 12 men: Khidham ibn Khalid (this mosque of opposition was an extension of his house),\nTha'labah ibn Hatib, Mu'attib ibn Qushayr, Abu Habibah ibn al-Az'ar, 'Abbad ibn Hunayf, Jariyah ibn 'Amir,\nhis two sons Majma' and Zayd, Nabtal ibn Harith, Bahzaj ibn 'Uthman, Bijad ibn 'Uthman and Wadi'ah ibn\nThabit. When they finished building this mosque, they went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and\ngive him peace, and said: 'We have built a mosque for the sick and the needy and also for use in rainy and\nwintry nights, and we would like you to come and pray in it'. He called for his gown, intending to wear it and\ngo with them when the Qur'an was revealed to him and Allah, glorious and majestic is He, informed him\nabout the mosque of opposition and what they were about to do. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, called Malik ibn al-Dukhshum, Ma'n ibn 'Adiyy, 'Amir ibn al-Sakan and Wahshiyy, the\nkiller of Hamzah and said to them: 'Go to this mosque whose builders have transgressed, destroy it and burn\nit down'. Malik proceeded with enflamed palm leaves, entered the mosque while its people were inside it,\nburnt it down and destroyed it. Its people dispersed [to avoid being burnt]. Then the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, commanded that that place be used as a garbage spot where carrion,\ndirt and refuse are thrown”.

Allah,\nexalted is He, then revealed (He launcheth the thunderbolts and smiteth with them whom He will while they\ndispute (in doubt) concerning Allah, and He is mighty in wrath). According to the reports of Abu Salih, Ibn\nJurayj and Ibn Zayd, Ibn 'Abbas said: “This verse and the verse before it were revealed about 'Amir ibn al-\nTufayl and Arbad ibn Rabi'ah. These two men went to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, and, as they were coming, one of the prophetic Companions said: 'O Messenger of Allah, here is\n'Amir ibn al-Tufayl coming toward you'. He said: 'Leave him, Allah will guide him if He wants good for him'.\nHe proceeded along until he stood in front of the Prophet and said: 'O Muhammad, what do I get if I\nbecome Muslim?' He said: 'You get what the Muslims get and you suffer what they suffer'. He said: 'In that\ncase put me in charge after you die'. He said: 'No, that is not up to me; that is up to Allah, exalted is He,\n\n\nand He appoints whoever He wills'. He said: 'In that case, put me in charge of the Arab nomads and you will\nbe in charge of the settlers'. The Prophet said: 'No!' He said: 'What are you going to give me, then?' He said:\n'I will give you the reins of horses to use in military conquest'. He said: 'Do I not have them already?' This\nman had told Arbad ibn Rabi'ah, that once he started talking to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, he should go behind the Prophet and strike him with his sword. Arbad pulled out his sword about a\nspan but Allah, exalted is He, jammed it and he could not pull it out completely. When 'Amir started\ngesturing to Arbad, The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, turned back and saw Arbad\nhandling his sword. He prayed: 'O Allah, deal with them for me as You will'. Allah, exalted is He, sent on\nArbad a thunderbolt, on a sunny day, and burned him. 'Amir ran away, saying: 'O Muhammad, you called\nyour Lord and He killed Arbad. By Allah, I will fill the land against you with unsaddled horses and unbearded\nyouths'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'Allah, exalted is He, will stop you\nfrom doing that, as will the Aws and the Khazraj'. 'Amir then spent the night in the house of a woman from\nBanu Salul. In the morning, he collected his weapons and left saying: 'By the Lat and al-'Uzza, would\nMuhammad and his companion (meaning the angel of death) show themselves to me, I will stab them with\nmy spear'. When Allah, exalted is He, saw how he behaved, He sent him an angel who hit him with his wing\nand thrust him on the dust. A huge gland, resembling a camel's gland, straightaway appeared on each of his\nknees. He returned to the house of the woman from Banu Salul, saying: 'A gland like a camel's gland, and\ndying in the house of the woman from Banu Salul', and he died on the back of his horse. Allah, exalted is\nHe, revealed about him this (Alike of you is he who hideth the saying and he who noiseth it abroad)",

Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (If ye punish, then punish\nwith the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted. But if ye endure patiently, verily it is better for the patient),\nupon which the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'I would rather be patient, O\nLord!' ” The commentators of the Qur'an said: “When the Muslims saw what the idolaters did to their dead\nat the Battle of Uhud in terms of ripping open their stomachs, cutting off their male organs and mutilating\nthem in the most ugly way, they said: 'If Allah gives us a chance to get our hands on them, we will mutilate\nthem even worse than what they did; we shall maim them in a way that none of the Arabs did before to any\nother Arab; and we shall do this and we shall do that'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, stopped at the body of his paternal uncle Hamzah with his nose and ears amputated, his male organs\ncut off and his stomach ripped open. Hind bint 'Utbah had taken a piece of his liver, chewed it and\nswallowed it but her stomach could not take it and she threw it up. When the Prophet, Allah bless him and\ngive him peace, heard of this, he said: 'She would have never entered hell if she did digest it; Hamzah is too\nnoble in the sight of Allah to allow any part of his body to enter hell'. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, saw Hamzah [lying dead and mutilated], he had never seen, before that,\nanything which was more painful to his heart. And so he said: 'May Allah's mercy be on you; you were, as\nfar as I know, someone who kept his ties of kinship and did always good deeds. Had it not been for the\ngrieving of those who survived of your family, it would have pleased me to leave you as you are until you\nare resurrected [on the Day of Judgement] from different bellies. By Allah, if Allah, exalted is He, gives me\nthe opportunity to lay my hand on them, I will mutilate seventy men of them, for what they did to you'. But\nAllah, exalted is He, revealed (If ye punish, then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted. But\nif ye endure patiently, verily it is better for the patient) and so the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, said: 'I would rather be patient', and then he made amends for the oath he had made”. Here, we\nneed to mention how Hamzah was killed. 'Amr ibn Abi 'Amr al-Muzakki informed us> Muhammad ibn Makki>\nMuhammad ibn Yusuf> Muhammad ibn Isma'il al-Ju'fi> Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah> Hujayn ibn\nal-Muthanna> 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Abi Salamah. And we were informed by Muhammad ibn\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Yahya> his father> Muhammad ibn Ishaq al-Thaqafi> Sa'id ibn Yahya al-\nUmawi> his father> Muhammad ibn Ishaq> 'Abd Allah ibn al-Fadl ibn 'Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'ah> Sulayman\nibn Yasar> Ja'far ibn 'Amr ibn Umayyah al-Damri who said: “I travelled with 'Ubayd Allah ibn 'Adiyy ibn al-\nKhiyar through Hums. While we were there 'Ubayd Allah said to me: 'Do you wish to go to visit Wahshiyy to\nask him how he killed Hamzah'. I said: 'If you want to'. A man said to us: 'You will find him in the courtyard\nof his house; he is a man who is always drunk. However, if he is sober, he will speak in Arabic and you\nmight find what you are after'. When we got to him, we greeted him and he raised his head. We said: 'We\nhave come to you to tell us about your killing of Hamzah, may Allah have mercy on him'. He said: 'I will\nrelate to you exactly what I related to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, when he\nasked me about the same. I was a slave of Jubayr ibn Mut'im ibn 'Adiyy ibn Nawfal whose uncle Tu'aymah\nibn 'Adiyy was killed at the Battle of Badr. When the Quraysh marched toward Uhud, Jubayr ibn Mut'im said\nto me: 'You are free if you kill Hamzah, Muhammad's uncle, as a revenge for the killing of my uncle\nTu'aymah'. I went out with them. It is to be remembered that I am an Abyssinian who is expert in throwing\nspears, like all Abyssinians, and I never missed my target. When the two sides met, I went looking for\nHamzah until I saw him in the middle of the army, like a white-and-black camel, slaughtering people with his\nsword such that nothing stood in his way. By Allah, I was waiting for my moment, hiding behind a rock or\ntree, so that he drew closer to me, when Siba' ibn 'Abd al-'Uzza passed me and went toward him. When\nHamzah, may Allah have mercy on him, saw him, he called him: 'Here, O son of a cutter of clitoris!' Then he\nstruck him on the head and, by Allah, he did not miss. I moved my spear about until I felt comfortable and\nthrew it at him. It caught him in the lower abdomen and the spear came out from his feet. He made a move\ntoward me and then collapsed and I left him to die. I went toward him, retrieved my spear and joined the\npeople at the camp. I did not want to kill anyone else, for I only killed him to gain my freedom. When I went\n\n\nback to Mecca, I was emancipated. I stayed there until Islam spread throughout it upon which I travelled to\nal-Ta'if. In Ta'if, they sent emissaries to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and\nmentioned that he does not harm emissaries. And so I went with them to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace. When he saw me, he said: 'Are you Wahshiyy?' and when I answered in the\naffirmative, he asked again: 'You are the one who killed Hamzah?' I said: 'What happened is exactly as it\nwas related to you'. He said: 'Could you keep your face away from me?' I left. When the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, died and Musaylimah the liar emerged to the people, I thought to go\nand kill Musaylimah to cancel out my killing of Hamzah. I went out with people, and what happened to him\nis now known' ”.",

He believed what they said. And when he went for the Battle of\nTabuk, he had the intention of going to Syria. But when he reached Tabuk, Allah, exalted is He, revealed\n(And they indeed wished to scare thee from the land)”. Mujahid, Qatadah and al-Hasan said: “The people of\nMecca were on the verge of driving the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, out of\nMecca, when Allah, exalted is He, commanded him to leave. He revealed this verse to inform him of what\nthe people of Mecca intended to do”.",

They sent to him with a\nmessage that the nobles of your people have gathered and want to speak with you. He came promptly,\nthinking that they had changed their mind about him, for he was keen to see them guided and was pained\nfor their stubbornness. When he sat with them, they said: 'O Muhammad, by Allah we do not know of any\nman among the Arabs who has introduced to his people what you have introduced. You have insulted our\nforefathers, censored our religion, accused us of ignorance, slandered our idols, divided the community and\nyou have not left anything revolting except that you have placed it between us and you. Now, if you have\nbrought all this to seek wealth, we will collect from our wealth so that you become the richest among us; if\nyou seek status, we will make you our chief; if you seek kingship, we will make you our king; and if the jinn\nthat appears to you has completely overwhelmed you, we will spend our money to get you the right\nmedicine to cure you or discharge our duty toward you'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, said to them: 'I do not have what you accuse me of. I did not bring you what I brought to seek\nwealth, status or kingship. Rather, it is Allah, glorious and majestic is He, Who has sent me to you as a\nMessenger. He has revealed to me a Scripture and commanded me to be a carrier of good tiding as well as a\nwarner. I have conveyed to you the message of my Lord and advised you well. If you accept that which I\nhave brought you, it is your share in this world and in the next. And if you reject it, I will be patient with the\njudgment of Allah until He judges between me and you'. They said: 'O Muhammad, if you do not accept our\noffer, then you know that, compared to other people, we have a more restricted land, a tougher life and\nmuch less wealth. So ask your Lord, Who has sent you with that which He has sent you, to remove from us\nthese mountains which have restricted our land and expand our country and run through it rivers like the\nrivers of Syria and Iraq. And let Him resurrect our dead forefathers, and among those resurrected, let Him\nresurrect Qusayy ibn Kilab, for he was a truthful old man, so that we ask them about whether what you say\nis true or false. If you do what we ask for, we will believe you and, by the same token, know your status\nwith Allah, and that He has sent you as a Messenger, as you claim'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\n\n\nand give him peace, said: 'I was not sent to bring what you have asked for. Rather, I came to you from\nAllah, glorious is He, with that which He has sent me, and I have conveyed to you what I have been sent\nwith to you. If you accept it, it is your share in this world and in the next; but if you reject it, I will be patient\nwith Allah's judgement'. They said: 'If you do not do what we have asked for, then ask your Lord to send an\nangel to confirm your message, and ask Him to provide you with gardens, treasures and palaces of gold and\nsilver which will suffice you from your needs, for you stand in the market place as we do, and strive to earn\na living as we do, in order that we appreciate your merit and position with your Lord, if you are truly a\nmessenger, as you claim to be'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'I will not\ndo it, nor am I someone to ask his Lord for such things, nor was I sent to you with this; He has rather sent\nme as a bringer of good tidings and as a warner'. They said: 'In that case, cause the heaven to fall\npiecemeal down on us, since you claim that your Lord can do so if He wills'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, said: 'That is up to Allah, He will do it if He wills'. One of them said: 'We will\nnot believe in you until you bring Allah and the angels as warrants. 'Abd Allah ibn Abi Umayyah al-Makhzumi\n\n- the son of 'Atikah bint 'Abd al-Muttalib, the maternal aunt of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace - said: 'I will never believe in you until you get a ladder and climb up to heaven while I am watching\nyou, and bring an unfolded Scripture with you and a group of angels to testify about what you say'. The\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, left to his family very sad for failing to get his\npeople to follow him as well as for the antagonism they displayed toward him.

They sent to him with a\nmessage that the nobles of your people have gathered and want to speak with you. He came promptly,\nthinking that they had changed their mind about him, for he was keen to see them guided and was pained\nfor their stubbornness. When he sat with them, they said: ‘O Muhammad, by Allah we do not know of any\nman among the Arabs who has introduced to his people what you have introduced. You have insulted our\nforefathers, censored our religion, accused us of ignorance, slandered our idols, divided the community and\nyou have not left anything revolting except that you have placed it between us and you. Now, if you have\nbrought all this to seek wealth, we will collect from our wealth so that you become the richest among us; if\nyou seek status, we will make you our chief; if you seek kingship, we will make you our king; and if the jinn\nthat appears to you has completely overwhelmed you, we will spend our money to get you the right\nmedicine to cure you or discharge our duty toward you’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\n\n\nhim peace, said to them: ‘I do not have what you accuse me of. I did not bring you what I brought to seek\nwealth, status or kingship. Rather, it is Allah, glorious and majestic is He, Who has sent me to you as a\nMessenger. He has revealed to me a Scripture and commanded me to be a carrier of good tiding as well as a\nwarner. I have conveyed to you the message of my Lord and advised you well. If you accept that which I\nhave brought you, it is your share in this world and in the next. And if you reject it, I will be patient with the\njudgment of Allah until He judges between me and you’. They said: ‘O Muhammad, if you do not accept our\noffer, then you know that, compared to other people, we have a more restricted land, a tougher life and\nmuch less wealth. So ask your Lord, Who has sent you with that which He has sent you, to remove from us\nthese mountains which have restricted our land and expand our country and run through it rivers like the\nrivers of Syria and Iraq. And let Him resurrect our dead forefathers, and among those resurrected, let Him\nresurrect Qusayy ibn Kilab, for he was a truthful old man, so that we ask them about whether what you say\nis true or false. If you do what we ask for, we will believe you and, by the same token, know your status\nwith Allah, and that He has sent you as a Messenger, as you claim’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, said: ‘I was not sent to bring what you have asked for. Rather, I came to you from\nAllah, glorious is He, with that which He has sent me, and I have conveyed to you what I have been sent\nwith to you. If you accept it, it is your share in this world and in the next; but if you reject it, I will be patient\nwith Allah’s judgement’. They said: ‘If you do not do what we have asked for, then ask your Lord to send an\nangel to confirm your message, and ask Him to provide you with gardens, treasures and palaces of gold and\nsilver which will suffice you from your needs, for you stand in the market place as we do, and strive to earn\na living as we do, in order that we appreciate your merit and position with your Lord, if you are truly a\nmessenger, as you claim to be’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘I will not\ndo it, nor am I someone to ask his Lord for such things, nor was I sent to you with this; He has rather sent\nme as a bringer of good tidings and as a warner’. They said: ‘In that case, cause the heaven to fall\npiecemeal down on us, since you claim that your Lord can do so if He wills’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, said: ‘That is up to Allah, He will do it if He wills’. One of them said: ‘We will\nnot believe in you until you bring Allah and the angels as warrants. ‘Abd Allah ibn Abi Umayyah al-Makhzumi\n— the son of ‘Atikah bint ‘Abd al-Muttalib, the maternal aunt of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace — said: ‘I will never believe in you until you get a ladder and climbed up to heaven while I am\nwatching you, and bring an unfolded Scripture with you and a group of angels to testify about what you\nsay’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, left to his family very sad for failing to get\nhis people to follow him as well as for the antagonism they displayed toward him. And so Allah, exalted is\nHe, revealed (And they say: We will not put faith in thee till thou cause a spring to gush forth from the earth\nfor us...).

One day, he sat in one of the congregations of Quraysh which attracted a\nhuge number of its members, and he wished that Allah, exalted is He, does not reveal to him on that day\nanything that might repel them from him. Allah, exalted is He, revealed to him then Surah al-Najm (By the\nstar when it stetteth...) [Surah 53]. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, recited it\nbut when he reached (Have ye thought upon al-Lat and al-'Uzza, and Manat, the third, the other) [53:19-\n20], the devil put on his tongue what he had secretly wished and hoped for and said: 'These are the mighty\ncranes (gharaniq) and their intercession is hoped for'. When the Quraysh heard this, they were very pleased.\nThe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, carried on reciting until the end of the Surah\nand then prostrated. All the Muslims followed suit and prostrated, and all the idolaters who were present\nprostrated too. All those who were present, whether Muslim or disbeliever, prostrated except al-Walid ibn al-\nMughirah and Abu Uhyahah Sa'id ibn al-'As who were too advanced in age and could not prostrate, but they\nboth grabbed a handful of dust and put their foreheads on it. The Quraysh then dispersed, happy with what\nthey heard. They said: 'Muhammad has mentioned our idols with complimentary terms. We know that Allah\ngives life and takes it away, He creates and provides sustenance, but these idols of ours will intercede for us\nwith Him. Now that Muhammad has associated them, we are all with him'. That evening, Gabriel, peace be\nupon him, went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: 'What have you\ndone? You recited to people that which I did not bring from Allah, glorified is He, and you said what I did\nnot say to you'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, felt very saddened and was\ngreatly scared of Allah. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse, upon which the Quraysh said:\n'Muhammad has regretted what he has mentioned regarding the status of our idols vis-à-vis Allah'.

The idolaters were pleased. They said: 'He has mentioned our\nidols'. Then Gabriel, peace be upon him, came to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, and said: 'Read back to me the speech of Allah'. When he read it to him, Gabriel said: 'As for this I\ndid not bring; this is from the devil'. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed (Never sent We a messenger or a\nprophet before thee but when He recited (the message) Satan proposed (opposition) in respect of that\nwhich he recited thereof.

Some poor Emigrants coveted their earnings, saying: ‘Why do we not marry them and live\nwith them until Allah, exalted is He, suffices us from them?’ They asked permission from the Messenger of\nAllah, Allah bless him and give him peace, to marry them, but then this verse was revealed which states that\nit is forbidden to marry an adulteress in order to exonerate the believers from such acts”. ‘Ikrimah said:\n“This verse was revealed about some prostitutes who worked openly in Mecca and Medina. There were so\nmany of them. However, nine of them had banners like the banners of al-Baytar by means of which they\n\n\nwere known. These nine prostitutes were: Umm Mahzul, the slave girl of al-Sa’ib ibn Abi al-Sa’ib al-\nMakhzumi, Umm ‘Ulayt, the slave girl of Safwan ibn Umayyah, Hannah the Copt, the slave girl of al-‘As ibn\nWa’il, Muznah, the slave girl of Malik ibn ‘Amilah ibn al-Subaq, Jalalah, the slave girl of Suhayl ibn ‘Amr,\nUmm Suwayd, the slave girl of ‘Amr ibn ‘Uthman al-Makhzumi, Sharifah, the slave girl of Zum‘ah ibn al-\nAswad, Farsah, the slave girl of Hisham ibn Rabi‘ah and Fartana, the slave girl of Hilal ibn Anas. The houses\nof these prostitutes were called, in the pre-Islamic period, mawakhir and those who entered them to buy\npleasure were either Muslim adulterers or idolaters, worshippers of idols. Some Muslims wanted to marry\nprostitutes to gain a living from them, and so Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse, warned the believers\nagainst it and made it forbidden unto them”.

And her condition for any man who proposed to marry her was that she\nwould provide for him [by continuing to sell herself]. A Muslim man wanted to marry her. He mentioned the\nmatter to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, and so this verse was revealed (The adulterer\nshall not marry save an adulteress or an idolatress).",

By Allah, he never married a woman who was not a virgin and no one amongst us ever dares to marry\nany woman he divorces, because of his extreme jealousy’. Sa‘d then said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, by Allah I\nknow it is the truth and that it is from Allah. But I was wondering: if I were to find a man on top of my wife,\nI am not supposed to disturb or move him until I go and bring four witnesses. By Allah, by the time I go to\nbring them, the man would have finished his business’. Not a long time had passed after this incident when\nHilal ibn Umayyah found a man with his wife upon returning in the afternoon from his field. He saw with his\neyes and heard with his ears. He did not react and waited until the following morning and went to see the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. He said to him: ‘O Messenger of Allah, I went to my\nwife in the afternoon and found her with a man. I saw them with my own eyes and heard them with my\nown ears’. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, disliked what he heard and was\ngreatly distressed as a result. ‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit said then: ‘Now the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, will flog Hilal ibn Umayyah and his testimony will be void among the Muslims’. Hilal\nsaid: ‘By Allah, I am hoping that Allah will make for me a way out of this’. Then he said: ‘O Messenger of\nAllah, I can see that you are distressed because of what I have told you. But Allah knows that I am saying\nthe truth’. By Allah, just as the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was about to order\nhis flogging, the revelation from heaven came to him. When the revelation came to him, the prophetic\nCompanions knew about it by the change in the complexion of his skin. They held back until the revelation\nstopped. The following verse was revealed (As for those who accuse their wives but have no witnesses\nexcept themselves) up to the end. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was\nrelieved. He said: ‘Good news for you, O Hilal! Allah has put you at ease and made for you a way out’. Hilal\nexclaimed: ‘That is what I was hoping for from my Lord’ ”. And the he mentioned the rest of the narration.\nMuhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad al-Faqih informed us> Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn\nSinan al-Muqri’> Ahmad ibn ‘Ali al-Muthanna> Abu Khaythmah> Jarir> al-A‘mash> Ibrahim> ‘Alqamah>\n‘Abd Allah who said: “We were in the mosque on Thursday night when a man from the Helpers came in and\nsaid: ‘A man finds his wife with another man [what can he do?]. If he speaks about it, you will flog him; if\nhe kills the man, you will kill him; and if he keeps quiet, he will suffer inwardly. By Allah, I will ask the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, about this’. The following morning he went to the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: ‘If a man finds his wife with another man\n[what can he do?]. If he speaks about it, you will flog him; if he kills the man, you will kill him; and if he\nkeeps quiet, he will suffer inside. O Allah, clarify the matter for us’, and he began making supplications. The\nverse of the public imprecation (li‘an) was revealed after that (As for those who accuse their wives but have\n\n\nno witnesses except themselves). One of the people was tried with this and so he came with his wife to the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, for public imprecation. The man gave testimony by\nAllah four times that he was saying the truth, on the fifth occasion he invoked Allah’s curse on himself if he\nwas lying. When his wife was about to contribute her part of this public imprecation, the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, asked her not to, but she went ahead and did it. The Messenger of\nAllah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: ‘The child she will give birth to will be black with curly hair’.\nAnd, surely, she gave birth to a child who was black and had curly hair”. This was narrated by Muslim from\nAbu Khaythmah.",

Al-Zuhri said: “All of them related to me a portion of her narration. Some of them\nremembered better what she related to them but they related only a summary of the report. I remembered\nall the reports related to me by each one of them. All the reports they related to me support each other.\nThey mentioned that 'A'ishah, may Allah be well pleased with her, the wife of the Prophet, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, said: 'When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, travelled, he\nwas in the habit of drawing lots, such that the one among his wives whose name is drawn travelled with\nhim. On one occasion, he wanted to set off for one of his military expedition, and so he drew lots to decide\nwho would accompany him among us. My lot was drawn and so I travelled with the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace. This happened after the verse of segregation (Hijab) was revealed. I\nwas therefore transported on my howdah and remained inside it for as long as we travelled. When the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, finished from his military expedition, he travelled\nback. We were close to Medina when one night it was announced that we were to make a move. When they\nannounced that they were moving, I walked until I went far beyond the camp. I relieved myself and headed\nback toward the camp. As I was walking back, I felt my chest and noticed that I had dropped my necklace\nwhich was made of gems from Dhafar. I went back to look for my necklace and got delayed. The people\nwho were in charge of my transportation came along, picked up my howdah and placed it on the mount I\nwas travelling on, assuming I was inside it. Women at that time were quite slim as a result of eating very\nlittle. This is why the lightness of the howdah did not disturb any of those men when they picked it up and\nplaced it on the mount. Moreover, I was quite young. And so they made the camel to stand and set off. My\nnecklace was found only after they had moved camp. I went back to the camp and found it deserted. I\nheaded toward the spot where I was camping and stayed there. I figured that people will notice my absence\nand come back to fetch me. As I was sitting in my location, my eyes dropped and I slept. Safwan ibn al-\nMu'attil al-Sulami/al-Dhakwani had camped behind the army. He set off the night before and by morning he\nreached my spot. He saw the silhouette of a person sleeping and came toward me. When he saw me, he\nrecognized me because he had seen me before I was commanded to stay out of the sight of men. When he\nsaid 'Verily, we are unto Allah and unto Him we shall return', upon recognizing me, I woke up and covered\nmy face with my outer garment. By Allah, he did not speak to me with another word nor did I hear him utter\nany other words except 'Verily, we are unto Allah and unto Him we shall return'. He made his camel kneel\ndown, stepped on its front legs [so that it does not move suddenly] and I mounted it. He led the mount until\nwe caught up with the army which had stopped to rest from the heat of the afternoon. Slander against me\nstarted at that point, and the main person behind it was 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul. When we arrived at\nMedina, I fell ill for a month, all while people were engaged in the talk of those who slandered me. What\nmade me bewildered during the time I was ill was that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, did not show toward me the gentleness I was used to see from him when I was sick. He would enter,\ngreet me the greeting of peace and simply say 'how art thou?' This used to pain me but I was still unaware\nof the evil that was going on. I started going out after my health improved. I went along with Umm Mistah\ntoward the location where we relieve ourselves. We did not go to this location except at night. This\nhappened before we had lavatories at our houses. Before that our custom was that of the Arabs as far as\nrelieving oneself is concerned, we disliked having lavatories close to our houses. I went out with Umm\nMistah to the lavatory'. Umm Mistah was the daughter of Abu Ruhm ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib ibn 'Abd Manaf and\n\n\nher mother was the daughter of Sakhr ibn 'Amir; she was the maternal aunt of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and her\nson was Mistah ibn Uthathah ibn 'Abbad ibn al-Muttalib. As we were returning home, after we finished, Umm\nMistah stumbled on her raiment and fell. She said [out of anger]: 'May Mistah be wretched!' I said to her:\n'What an awful thing to say! Do you insult a man who has fought at Badr?' She said: 'Did you not hear what\nhe said?' 'And what did he say?' I asked. And so she informed me about the slander perpetuated against me.\nI got even more ill. When I went back to my house, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, came in and after greeting me and asking me how I was, I said: 'Allow me to go to my parents!' I\nwanted then to ascertain the matter from both of them. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, gave me permission to go to my parents. I asked my mother: 'Mother, what are people saying\nabout me?' She said: 'My daughter, pay little attention to what is being said. By Allah, it is seldom that a\nman marries a beautiful woman except that the other co-wives cause troubles for her'. I said: 'Glory be to\nAllah, did people say this about me and the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, heard\nabout it?' When she answered in the affirmative, I cried all night until the morning. I could not stop crying\nnor was I able to sleep'. When revelation was slow to come, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and\ngive him peace, summoned 'Ali ibn Abi Talib and Usamah ibn Zayd to consult them about leaving his wife. As\nfor Usamah ibn Zayd, his advice to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, was given\non the basis of his knowledge that the Prophet's wife was innocent and also because of the affection he had\ntoward her. He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, she is your wife and we know nothing but good about her'. On\nthe other hand, 'Ali ibn Abi Talib said: 'Allah, exalted is He, has not constricted you; there are plenty other\nwomen. If you ask her slave-girl, she will surely tell you the truth'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, summoned Barirah and said to her: 'O Barirah, did you see anything suspicious from\n'A'ishah?' Barirah said: 'By Him Who has sent you with the truth, I have never found fault with her regarding\nany matter more than the fact that she is a young lady who sometimes sleeps while looking after her\nfamily's dough and domesticated animals come and eat it'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, went and asked to be excused if he should harm 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul. He said while on\nthe pulpit: 'O Muslims, who would give me leave to punish a man who has hurt me regarding my wife. By\nAllah, I know nothing but good about my wife, and they have mentioned a man about whom I also know\nnothing but good; this man never entered in on my wife except with me'. Sa'd ibn Mu'adh stood up and\nsaid: 'O Messenger of Allah, I give you leave; if this man is of the Aws, I will behead him; and if he is of our\nbrothers the Khazraj, you command us to do with him as you see fit'. Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah, who was a righteous\nman but stirred up by tribal solidarity, stood up and said: 'You lie, by Allah, you will not kill him nor will you\nbe able to do so!' Usayd ibn Hudayr, the cousin of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, said to Sa'd ibn 'Ubadah: 'You lie, by\nAllah, we will kill him. You are but a hypocrite arguing on behalf of the hypocrites'. The two tribes of Aws\nand Khazraj erupted and were on the verge of fighting each other while the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, was still standing on the pulpit. He kept trying to be quiet until they all stopped\ntalking and then he went silent himself. I cried all that day and could not sleep. My parents thought that\ncrying would eventually kill me. As they were sitting with me while I was crying, a woman from the Helpers\nasked permission to come in to see me. She came in and sat down, crying with me. As we were in this state,\nthe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, entered in on us and sat down. He had not sat\nwith me since I was slandered. Since then, one month had elapsed and he still did not receive any revelation\nconcerning me. When he sat down, the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, uttered the\ntestification of faith and then said: 'O 'A'ishah, I was told such-and-such a thing about you. If you are\ninnocent, Allah will clear you. But If you have committed a sin, then you should ask forgiveness from Allah\nand repent to Him, for when a slave acknowledges his sins and then repents, Allah will accept his\nrepentance'. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, had finished what he\nwanted to say, my tears receded such that I could not feel even a drop of it coming out. I said to my father:\n'Answer the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, on my behalf'. He said: 'By Allah, I do\nnot know what to say to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace'. I said to my mother:\n'Answer the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, on my behalf'. She said: 'By Allah, I do\nnot know what to say to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace'. I said, [keeping in\nmind that] I was then a very young lady who did not read much of the Qur'an: 'By Allah, I know that you\nheard this [slander] and since it has already been established in your mind, you have believed it. If I were to\ntell you I am innocent - and Allah knows that I am innocent - you will not believe me; and if I were to\nconfess something from which Allah knows I am innocent, you would believe me. By Allah, I cannot find\nanything to describe the like of me and you, except what the father of Joseph said: ((My course is) comely\npatience. And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought in that (predicament) which ye describe)",

The people of Medina did not allow the blind, lame or sick person to share their food\nbecause they considered them dirty. For this reason, Allah, exalted is He, revealed this verse”. Said Mujahid:\n“This verse was revealed to grant dispensation for the sick and the elderly to eat from the houses which\nAllah, exalted is He, has named in this verse. This is because some Companions of the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, used to go to the houses of their fathers and mothers or the houses of\nsome of those who were named in this verse, when they did not have food to give to them. The elderly and\nthe sick were uncomfortable about eating that food because it was given to them by other than the rightful\nowners of that food. They used to say: ‘Verily, they take us to houses which are not theirs’, and so Allah,\nexalted is He, revealed this verse”. Al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Farisi informed us> Muhammad ibn ‘Abd\nAllah ibn al-Fadl al-Tajir> Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Hafiz> Muhammad ibn Yahya> Isma‘il ibn\nAbi Uways> Malik> Ibn Shihab> Sa‘id ibn al-Musayyab who used to say about this verse: “It was revealed\nabout some people who used to leave the keys of their houses, upon travelling with the Prophet, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, with the blind, the lame and the sick as well as with their next of kin. They also\nused to enjoin them to eat from their houses if they needed to, but those with whom the keys were\nentrusted did not eat from these houses, saying: ‘We fear they will not be pleased if we do’, and so Allah,\nexalted is He, revealed this verse”.

Other commentators of the Qur’an said: “Ubayy ibn Khalaf and ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu‘ayt\nwere allies. It was the habit of ‘Uqbah, upon returning from a travel, to invite the nobles of his people to eat\nwith him. ‘Uqbah also used to keep the company of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him\npeace.

Ubayy was absent on that\noccasion. But when he was informed of what had happened, he said to ‘Uqbah: ‘You have renounced the\nreligion of your forefathers?’ ‘Uqbah said: ‘By Allah, I did not. I had a man in my house who refused to eat\nmy food unless I bore witness to him and I was ashamed to let him leave my house without him eating, and\nso I bore witness to him and he ate my food’. Ubayy said to him: ‘I will never be happy with you until you\ngo to him, spit on his face and step on his neck’. ‘Uqbah did just that, and the Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, said to him: ‘If I ever meet out of Mecca, I will behead you’. ‘Uqbah was later\nkilled while in captivity at Badr. As for Ubayy ibn Khalaf, the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace,\nkilled him in a duel at Uhud. And so Allah, exalted is He, revealed about ‘Uqbah and Ubayy this verse”. Said\nal-Dahhak: “When ‘Uqbah spat on the face of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,\nhis spit split into two and flew back on ‘Uqbah’s face.

Through this, Allah has preferred the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, over\nall other messengers and singled you out from all other communities. Do, therefore, meet Allah's bounty\nwith gratitude' ”. I heard master Abu 'Uthman al-Hafiz say that he heard Imam Sahl ibn Muhammad ibn\nSulayman say: “The honour that Allah, exalted is He, bestowed upon our Prophet, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, by His saying (Lo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet) is more far-reaching\nand more complete than the honour bestowed upon Adam, peace be upon him, when the angels were\nordered to prostrate to him. This is because it is not conceivable that Allah be with the angels upon the\nbestowal of that honour. However, Allah, exalted is He, has informed that He Himself showers blessings on\nthe Prophet, and then He informed that the angels do shower blessings upon him. Therefore, an honour\n\n\nwhich ensues from Him is much far-reaching than an honour which ensues from the angels only and which\nis inconceivable that Allah be with them upon its bestowal”. What Sahl has said is taken from the saying of\nal-Mahdi. He might have come across it, adopted some of it and explained it further. He also compared it\nwith the honour bestowed upon Adam and showed that it is more far-reaching and complete than it. It is\nalso mentioned in the rigorously authenticated collections of prophetic sayings the following: Abu Bakr ibn\nIbrahim al-Farisi informed us> Muhammad ibn 'Isa ibn 'Amrawayh> Ibrahim ibn Sufyan> Muslim> Qutaybah\nand 'Ali ibn Hajar> Isma'il ibn Ja'far> al-'Ala'> his father> Abu Hurayrah who reported that the Messenger\nof Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: “Whoever invokes blessings on me once, Allah will invoke\nblessings upon him ten times”.",

O Muhammad!' Allah, exalted is He, then revealed (Lo! those who call thee from behind the\nprivate apartments, most of them have no sense)”. Muhammad ibn Ishaq and others said: “This verse was\nrevealed about some uncouth people from Banu Tamim. A delegation of the Banu Tamim went to see the\nProphet, Allah bless him and give him peace. They entered the mosque and called the Prophet, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, who was in his private apartment: 'O Muhammad, come out to meet us, for our\npraise is nice while our censure is nasty'. Their shouting annoyed the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, and so he came out to see them. They said: 'O Muhammad, we have come to brag to you'. Allah,\nexalted is He, revealed about them (Lo! those who call thee from behind the private apartments, most of\nthem have no sense). Among these people were al-Aqra' ibn Habis, 'Uyaynah ibn Hisn, al-Zibriqan ibn Badr\nand Qays ibn 'Asim”. This incident of bragging was related to us by Abu Ishaq Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-\nMuqri'> al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Sadusi> al-Hasan ibn Salih ibn Hani'> al-Fadl ibn\nMuhammad ibn al-Musayyab> al-Qasim ibn Abi Shaybah> Mu'alla ibn 'Abd al-Rahman> 'Abd al-Hamid ibn\nJa'far> 'Umar ibn al-Hakam> Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah who said: “A delegation from Banu Tamim came to see the\nProphet, Allah bless him and give him peace. They called him from outside his doorstep: 'O Muhammad,\ncome out to meet us, for our praise is nice while our censure is nasty'. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give\n\n\nhim peace, heard them and came out, saying: 'Indeed, it is only Allah whose praise is nice and censure\nnasty'. They said: 'We are people from Banu Tamim; we have brought our poet and our orator to show you\nour excellence over you in poetry and brag about our merits'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and\ngive him peace, said: 'I was not sent with poetry nor was I commanded to brag. But let us see what you\nhave!' al-Zibriqan ibn Badr said to one of their youths: 'Stand up and mention your merit and the merit of\nyour people'. The youth stood up and said: 'Praise be to Allah Who has made us the best of His created\nbeings; He gave us riches with which we do as we please. We are, therefore, of the best among the\ninhabitants of the earth and of those who have more means, wealth and arms. Whoever denies what we\nhave said, let him say words better than our words and mention works better than ours'. The Messenger of\nAllah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to Thabit ibn Qays ibn Shimas: 'Stand and respond to him!'\nThabit stood up and said: 'Praise be to Allah; I praise Him and seek His assistance; I believe in Him and in\nHim I fully trust. I bear witness that there is no deity except Allah, alone without any partners, and I bear\nwitness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger who called the Emigrants amongst his cousins - who are\nendowed with the most beautiful faces and the greatest intelligences - and they followed him. So praise be\nto Allah Who made us the helpers and aids of His Messenger and a cause for the triumph of His religion. We\ntherefore fight people until they bear witness that there is no deity except Allah. Whoever utters the\nexpression of faith renders his own person and wealth inviolable as far as we are concerned. But whoever\nrejects faith, we kill him and killing him for the sake of Allah, exalted is He, would indeed be easy for us. I\nsay these words of mine and seek Allah's forgiveness for the believing men and women'. Al-Zibriqan ibn\nBadr then addressed one of their youths, saying: 'Stand up, O so-and-so, and say some poetry in which you\nmention your merit and the merit if your people'. A youth stood up and said: We are the nobles, no tribe is\nour equal The leaders are amongst us and the fourth of all booties is given to us. In time of drought we feed\nall people From the thin clouds of Autumn when wind-driven clouds fail to show. If we scorn, none can\nstand up to us Thus upon boasting do we rise. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,\nsent for Hassan ibn Thabit and when the emissary reached him, Hassan said: 'What does he want, I was\nwith him just a while ago?' The emissary said: 'Banu Tamim brought their poet and orator and the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, commanded Thabit ibn Qays to respond to their\norator, and he has sent for you to respond to their poet'. When Hassan arrived, the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, commanded him to respond to their poet. Hassan said: 'O Messenger of\nAllah, ask him to repeat what he composed'. When the poetry was repeated to him, he said: We supported\nAllah's Messenger and religion by force In spite of the enemy of the desert and settlements. Do we not\nembrace death in the turmoil of battle When the resort of death becomes sweet among armies. And we\nstrike the heads of armoured fighters as we belong To a lineage from the root of the mighty Ghassan. If it\nwere not for diffidence toward Allah we would say, displaying our nobleness to people, at the base of the\ntwo mountains, is there any who would like to fight. Our living ones are of the best of those who have set\nfoot on the ground And our dead are the best inhabitants of the graveyards. At this point al-Aqra' ibn Habis\nstood up and said: 'By Allah, I have come for something other than that which these people have come for.\nI have composed some poetry, so hear it!' He said: 'Let us hear it'. Al-Aqra' said: To you we have come so\nthat people recognise our merit When they boast to us upon mentioning noble traits. We are the leaders of\npeople at any company In the land of Hijaz there is nothing like Darim. In every single raid we have a fourth\nof the booty Whether the raid is in Najd or the land of al-Taha'im. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, said: 'Stand up, O Hassan, and respond to him'. Hassan stood up and said: Banu Darim,\ndo not boast, for your boasting Turns to your disadvantage upon mentioning noble traits. You lost your\nminds when you boasted to us when you are Our chattels, some of you wet nurses and some servants. The\nbest glory and high rank you could ever get Is to come next to us upon mentioning those who are nobler. If\nyou have come to spare your lives And wealth and share what is to be shared, Then ascribe not an equal to\nAllah and embrace Islam And do not boast to the Prophet about Darim. Otherwise, by the Lord of the\nHouse, our hands will strike Your necks with sharp swords. Al-Aqra' ibn Habis said: 'Indeed, Muhammad is\nassisted; I do not know what this matter is. Their orator spoke better than ours and their poet composed\nbetter poetry than that of our poet'. Al-Aqra' then drew closer to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and\ngive him peace, and said: 'I bear witness that that there is no deity except Allah and that you are the\nMessenger of Allah', upon which the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to him: 'Whatever\nhappened before will not harm you!' The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, gave them\ngifts and clothed them. Voices were raised and much clamour ensued before the Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace. Allah, exalted is He, therefore revealed these verses (Lift not up your voices\nabove the voice of the Prophet...) up to His words (... and immense reward)”.",

The Helpers said: 'We have received him in our homes, helped him and\nconsoled him with our riches but he preferred this Abyssinian slave over us'. Allah, glorious and majestic is\nHe, then revealed this verse (O mankind! Lo!

And they disagreed amongst themselves.\nSome said: “Do not cut the palm-trees down for it is part of what Allah has given us as spoils”. Others said:\n“We should rather cut them down!” And so Allah, glorified and exalted is He, revealed (Whatsoever palm-\ntrees ye cut down...) confirming the opinion of those who warned against cutting the palm-trees down and,\nat the same time, stating the lawfulness of cutting them down. He informed that the cutting down of trees\nor leaving them standing is only by the leave of Allah, exalted is He.

It happened that Sarah, the client of Abu 'Amr\nibn Sayfi ibn Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf travelled from Mecca to Medina to see the Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, and found him getting ready to conquer Mecca. He asked her: 'Have you\ncome as a Muslim?' When she answered in the negative, he asked: 'What has brought you here, then?' She\nsaid: 'You were my family, my clan and my patrons; I am in desperate need and have come so that you give\nme and clothe me'. He said: 'What happened to all the youths of Mecca', he asked her this because she was\na singer. She said: 'No one has ever requested anything from me after the Battle of Badr!' The Messenger of\nAllah, Allah bless him and give him peace, encouraged the Banu 'Abd al-Muttalib and the Banu'l-Muttalib to\nbe generous to her. They clothed her, gave her money and provided her with a mount. Hatib ibn Abi\nBalta'ah then got in touch with her, gave her ten pieces of gold and gave her a letter to hand over to the\npeople of Mecca. He wrote in this letter: 'From Hatib to the people of Mecca: The Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, is about to attack you, so take precautions'. Sarah left and Gabriel, peace be\nupon him, came down and informed the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, of what Hatib had\ndone. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent 'Ali, 'Ammar, al-Zubayr, Talhah, al-\nMiqdad ibn al-Aswad and Abu Marthad - who were all horsemen - saying to them: 'Proceed to the meadow\nof Khakh. You will find there a woman on a camel-borne sedan chair. This woman has a letter from Hatib to\nthe idolaters. Take that letter from her and let her go. But if she refuses to hand over the letter to you,\nbehead her'. They proceeded to that location and found the woman there. They asked her: 'Where is the\nletter?' She swore by Allah that she did not have any letter with her. They searched her belongings but could\nnot find the letter. They were about to leave when 'Ali said: 'By Allah, he did not tell us a lie, nor do we\ndisbelieve in what he said to us'. He unsheathed his sword and said: 'Give us the letter or, by Allah, I will\nstrip you of your clothes and then severe your head'. When she saw the seriousness of the matter, she got\nout the letter from her lock, for she had hid it in her hair, and they let her go. They went back to the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. He sent for Hatib and when the latter came, the\n\n\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, asked him: 'Do you recognize this letter?' And when\nhe answered in the affirmative, he asked: 'What drove you to do it?' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah, by\nAllah, I have not disbelieved since I became Muslim, nor did I betray you since I took your side, nor did I\nlove them [the idolaters] since I departed from them. However, there is not a single person among the\nEmigrants except that he has someone to defend his closest relatives [in Mecca]. And since I am a stranger\namong them, and my family lives amongst them, I feared for them, and so I wanted to have some\nassistance from them, even though I knew that Allah will send His harm upon them and that my letter will\nbe of no avail to them'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, believed and forgave\nhim. This verse was then revealed (O ye who believe! Choose not My enemy and your enemy for allies...).\n'Umar ibn al-Khattab stood up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, let me strike the neck of this hypocrite!' But\nthe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'O 'Umar, what do you know? It could be\nthat Allah has looked at the people of Badr and said: 'Do what you please for I have forgiven you' ”. Abu\nBakr Ahmad ibn al-Hasan ibn 'Amr informed us> Muhammad ibn Ya'qub> al-Rabi'> al-Shafi'i> Sufyan ibn\n'Uyaynah> 'Amr ibn Dinar> al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn 'Ali> 'Ubayd Allah ibn Abi Rafi'> 'Ali who said: “The\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, sent us, al-Zubayr, al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad and me,\nsaying: 'Proceed to the meadow of Khakh where you will find a woman on a camel-borne sedan chair who\nhas a letter'. And so we set off riding our horses and proceeded until we found a woman on a camel-borne\nsedan chair. We said to her: 'Take the letter out'. She said: 'I do not have any letter!' We said to her: 'You\nwill either give us the letter or we will strip you naked'. When she heard this, she got the letter from her\nbraids. We took it to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace. The letter read: 'From\nHatib ibn Abi Balta'ah to some people of the idolaters of Mecca', and informed them about some of what the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, intended to do. The Prophet, Allah bless him and\ngive him peace, asked Hatib: 'What is this, O Hatib?' Hatib answered: 'Do not be hasty [in judging me], I am\na man who is just annexed to the Quraysh, for I am not a Qurashite. All the Emigrants you have with you\nhave relatives who will protect their own relatives. I have no relatives in Mecca, and since I lacked relatives I\nwanted to get some assistance from them. By Allah, I did not do it because I doubt my religion nor because\nI have accepted disbelief after choosing Islam'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace,\nsaid: 'He has said the truth!' But 'Umar exclaimed: 'Let me strike the neck of this hypocrite!' The Prophet,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, said: 'He has taken part in the Battle of Badr; and you do not know,\nperhaps Allah has looked at those who took part in the Battle of Badr and said: 'Do as you please for I have\nforgiven you'. Then this verse was revealed (O ye who believe! Choose not My enemy and your enemy for\nallies...)”. This was narrated by Bukhari from al-Humaydi and by Muslim from Abu Bakr ibn Shaybah and\nanother group, all of whom related it from Sufyan.",

We used to hasten for water but the desert\nArabs always preceded us to it. Once a desert Arab got to the water first, he would fill the pond, circle it\nwith stones and place a leather mat on it until his friends would arrive. One man from the Helpers came\nalong wanting to let his camel drink from one such pond, but a desert Arab refused to let him use the pond.\nThe Helper removed one of the stones encircling the water which caused the water to spill. The desert Arab\ngrabbed a piece of wood and struck him on the head, fracturing his skull in the process. The Helper went to\n'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, the leader of the hypocrites, and informed him of the incident. This Helper was one of\nthe followers of Ibn Ubayy. 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy got very angry and said: 'Do not spend on those who are\nwith the Messenger of Allah, until they [i.e. the desert Arabs] disperse'. He also said to his followers: 'When\nyou go back to Medina, let the most powerful drive the weakest out of Medina'.

People came forward to get water. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab had with him\na hireling from Banu Ghifar by the name of Jahjah ibn Sa'id. The latter led 'Umar's horse to drink. A jostle\nabout the water ensued between Jahjah and Sinan al-Juhani, the ally of Banu 'Awf from the Khazraj and the\ntwo of them had a fight. Al-Juhani cried: 'O Helpers [help!]' and the Ghifari shouted: 'O Emigrants [help!]' A\n\n\npoor man from the Emigrants by the name of Ju'al came to the rescue of Jahjah. 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy said\nto him: 'You, out of all people!' Ju'al said: 'And what stops me from getting involved?' And he let his tongue\nloose on 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy. 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy then said: 'By Him through Whom one swears, I will\nleave you now, but you will see what will happen to you'. 'Abd Allah was furious. He commented further: 'By\nAllah, our situation with these people is as one poet has once said: Fatten your dog, it will devour you.\nVerily, by Allah, if we do return to Medina, the mighty amongst us shall drive out the weak from it'. By the\nmighty he was referring to himself and by the weak to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him\npeace. He then addressed those who were present from among his own people, saying: 'You have brought\nthis on yourselves: you welcomed them in your land and shared with them your wealth. By Allah, if you\nwere to withhold your surplus of food from Ju'al and his family, they would not oppress you and might even\nleave your land. Do not, therefore, spend on them until they disperse from Muhammad'. Zayd ibn Arqam,\nwho was there present, said: 'By Allah, you are the one who is weak, isolated and hated amongst your own\npeople while Muhammad is mighty by the will of the All-merciful and affection of all Muslims. By Allah, I will\nnever love you after what you have just said!' 'Abd Allah said to him: 'Be quiet, I was just jesting'. Zayd ibn\nArqam went straight to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give peace, and informed him of what\nhad happened. 'Umar ibn al-Khattab who was there said: 'O Messenger of Allah, let me strike his neck!' 'If\nyou did that, a lot of people in Yathrib will rise to avenge him', answered the Prophet, Allah bless him and\ngive him peace. 'Umar said: 'If you dislike that he be killed by a man from the Emigrants, then ask Sa'd ibn\n'Ubadah, Muhammad ibn Maslamah or 'Ubadah ibn Bishr to kill him'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, said: 'People will say, in that case, that Muhammad is killing his own Companions'. The\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, then sent for 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy and, when he\ncame, asked him: 'Did you say the things which were reported to me about you?' 'Abd Allah said: 'By Him\nwho revealed the Book to you, I did not say any such thing; Zayd is a liar!' 'Abd Allah was treated as a noble\nand highly-respected person by his people. Those who were present among the Helpers said: 'O Messenger\nof Allah, 'Abd Allah is our leader and chief, do not believe what one boy of the Helpers says about him; he\ncould be mistaken about what he has heard and did not report it properly'. The Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, gave 'Abd Allah the benefit of the doubt. The fingers of blame among the\nHelpers all pointed to Zayd. They all gave him the lie. His uncle said to him: 'All you have done is that the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, has given you the lie and the Muslims detest you'.\nAfter this, Zayd was ashamed to go near the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. When the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, departed he was met by Usayd ibn Hudayr. The\nProphet, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to him: 'Did you hear what your man. Abd Allah ibn\nUbayy, said?' 'And what did he say?' asked Usayd. 'He claimed that upon returning to Medina the mighty will\ndrive out the weak'. Usayd: 'It is you, O Messenger of Allah, who will drive him out, if you wish. You are the\nmighty and he is the weak'. Then he said: 'O Messenger of Allah, be gentle with him; by Allah, Allah has\nbrought you when his people were preparing to crown him as their king. He thinks that you have deprived\nhim of kingship'. When 'Abd Allah ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy heard about what his father had said, he went to\nthe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, and said: 'I heard that you want to kill 'Abd\nAllah ibn Ubayy for what you heard about him. If you are to do it, command me to kill him. I will bring you\nhis head! By Allah, the Khazraj know that they do not have a man who is more dutiful toward his parents\nthan I am. And I fear that if you were to ask someone to kill him, my ego will not permit me to look at the\nkiller of 'Abd Allah walking among people and I would kill him and enter hellfire for killing a believer'. The\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said: 'We will rather treat him well as long as he is\nwith us'. When the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, returned to Medina, Zayd ibn\nArqam said: 'I stayed at home because of anxiety and shame. Then Allah, exalted is He, revealed Surah al-\nMunafiqun, confirming my words and giving the lie to 'Abd Allah. When this Surah was revealed, the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, grabbed Zayd's ear and said: 'O Zayd, Allah has\nconfirmed what you heard'. 'Abd Allah was then approaching Medina. His son, 'Abd Allah ibn 'Abd Allah,\nwent to camp at a spot where all the roads to Medina converged. When 'Abd Allah reached that spot, his\nson said to him: 'Go back!' 'Abd Allah exclaimed, 'Woe unto you, what ails you!' His son said: 'By Allah, you\nwill never enter it except by leave of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, so that you\nwould know today who is the mighty and who is the weak'. 'Abd Allah complained to the Messenger of Allah,\nAllah bless him and give him peace, about what his own son did, and the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, sent to 'Abd Allah ibn 'Abd Allah asking him to let his father enter Medina. When he\nreceived the order of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, he said: 'Yes, now you can\nenter!' And he entered Medina. When this Surah was revealed and it was clear that he lied, people said to\n\n\nhim: 'O Abu Hubab! Severe verses of the Qur'an have been revealed about you, why do you not go to the\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, so that he asks forgiveness for you'. But he just\nturned his face away. This is what is referred to by the saying of Allah, exalted is He (And when it said unto\nthem: Come! The messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you!

So he went home and said to his wife: “The Messenger of Allah, Allah\nbless him and give him peace, commanded both of us to often repeat 'there is no strength or might except\nby Allah' ”. She said: “How good is that with which he has commanded us!” And they both started saying it\nstraightaway. It happened that the enemy became distracted from their son and the latter led their sheep\n\n\naway and fled. He brought these sheep to his father; they were four thousand heads. This verse was\nrevealed about this incident. 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn 'Abdan informed us> Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah ibn Nu'aym>\nAbu'l-Qasim al-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Sakuni> 'Ubayd ibn Kathir al-'Amiri> 'Abbad ibn\nYa'qub> Yahya ibn Adam> Isra'il> 'Ammar ibn Mu'awiyah> Salim ibn Abi al-Ja'd> Jabir ibn 'Abd Allah who\nsaid: “This verse (And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah, Allah will appoint a way out for him, And will\nprovide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation) was revealed about a man from Ashja'.\nThis man was poor but had numerous children. He went to the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give\nhim peace, and asked him for help. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, told him: 'Fear Allah\nand be patient!' The man went back to his companions and when they asked him about what the Prophet\nhad given him, he said: 'He did not give me anything; he simply said: Fear Allah and be patient'. Not long\nafter this, a son of this man, who had been captured by the enemy, brought him sheep. The man went to\nthe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, to ask him about what he should do with the\nsheep, and told him the full story. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, said to him:\n'Keep them, they are yours' ”.",

He swore to her that he will not touch her and then said: 'Do not mention this\nincident to anyone'. But she went ahead and informed 'A'ishah. The Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, decided not to go to his wives for a month. He stayed away from them twenty nine days when Allah,\nglorious and exalted is He, revealed (O Prophet! Why bannest thou that which Allah hath made lawful for\nthee, seeking to please thy wives?)”. Abu Ibrahim Isma'il ibn Ibrahim al-Wa'iz informed us> Bishr ibn Ahmad\nibn Bishr> Ja'far ibn al-Hasan al-Firyabi> Minjab ibn al-Harith> 'Ali ibn Mushir> Hisham ibn 'Urwah> his\nfather> 'A'ishah who said: “The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, used to like sweet\nand honey. It was also his habit to go to his wives after finishing the 'Asr prayer. In one occasion he went to\nHafsah bint 'Umar and stayed with her more than he usually did. When I found out about this, I enquired\nabout the reason and I was told that a woman from her clan gifted her with a pot of honey which she\noffered to the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace. I said to myself: by Allah I will spoil it for him. I\nsaid to Sawdah bint Zam'ah: 'When he comes to your apartment and draws closer to you, say: O Messenger\nof Allah, did you eat Maghafir?' When he says: 'Hafsah fed me some honey', say: 'The bees which produced\nit must have eaten the 'Urfut'. I will say the same thing, and you, Safiyyah, should say the same'. Sawdah\nsaid: 'By Allah, the moment he stood at the door I was about to begin what she commanded me to do'.\n\n\nWhen he drew closer to her she said: 'O Messenger of Allah, did you eat Maghafir?' 'No!' he replied. She\nsaid: 'Then, what is this smell on you?' He said: 'Hafsah fed me some honey!' she said: “The bees which\nproduced it must have eaten the 'Urfut'. When he came to me, I said the same thing. And when he went to\nSafiyyah she also repeated the same thing. When it was Hafsah's turn and the Prophet went to her, she said\nto him: 'O Messenger of Allah, shall I feed you some of that honey?' He said: 'I do not feel like it!' Sawdah\nsaid: 'Glory be to Allah, we have deprived him [of honey]'. But I said to her: 'Be quiet!' ” This was narrated\nby Bukhari from Farwah ibn Abi al-Maghra', and also by Muslim from Suwayd ibn Sa'id ; and both Farwah\nand Suwayd related it from 'Ali ibn Mushir. Abu 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Hamid informed us> Zahir ibn\nAhmad> al-Husayn ibn Muhammad ibn Mus'ab> Yahya ibn Hakim> Abu Dawud> 'Amir al-Khazzaz> Ibn Abi\nMulaykah who related that Sawdah bint Zam'ah had relatives from her mother's side in the Yemen who used\nto gift her honey. Among all the wives of the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, Hafsah and\n'A'ishah were very close to each other. One of them said to the other: “Do you not see this? He goes to her\nwhen it is not her turn just to have some of that honey. So when he comes to you hold your nose, and when\nhe asks you about the reason, say: I smell something in you that I do not know what it is. When he comes\nto me, I shall say the same thing”. When the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, went to her she\nheld her nose. He asked her: “What's wrong?” She said: “I smell something in you and I think it is the smell\nof Maghafir”. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, used to put on him good perfume\nwhenever he found it. When he went to his other wife and she said the same thing. He said: “So-and-so said\nthe same thing to me; this must be something that I ate at the house of Sawdah, and, by Allah, I will never\neat it again!” Ibn Abi Mulaykah reported that Ibn 'Abbas said: “The verse (O Prophet! Why bannest thou that\nwhich Allah hath made lawful for thee, seeking to please thy wives?) was revealed about this [the incident\nreported above]”.",

The Jews approached\nhim and kept after him until he gave them some fallen hair from the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, as well as a few teeth from his comb. The Jews used these to cast a spell of black magic on him. The\nperson who was behind this was the Jew Labid ibn al-A'sam. He then put the hair in a well belonging to\nBanu Zurayq called Dharwan. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, fell ill for a period\nof six month, during which the hair of his head fell off; he imagined that he slept with his wives when he did\nnot, and was withering away without knowing the reason. As he was one day sleeping, he saw two angels\ncoming to him. One of them sat at his head and the other at his feet. The angel who sat at his head asked:\n'What is wrong with the man?' The second angel responded: 'A spell of black magic was cast on him'. The\nfirst one asked: 'And who is responsible for this sorcery?' The second angel answered: 'It is Labid ibn al-\nA'sam, the Jew'. The first angel asked again: 'What did he use to cast black magic on him?' The second\nangel said: 'He used a comb and fallen hair'. The first angel asked: 'Where is it now?' The second angel said:\n'It is inside the spadix of a palm tree beneath the stepping stone which is inside the well of Dharwan', at\nwhich point the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, woke up. He said: 'O 'A'ishah, do\nyou not think that this is from Allah to inform me of the cause of my illness?' He then sent 'Ali [ibn Abi\nTalib], al-Zubayr [ibn al-'Awwam] and 'Ammar [ibn Yasir] who drained the water of that well as one would\ndrain the dust of henna. They lifted the stone and got the spadix out and found therein some of the hair of\nthe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, as well a few teeth from his comb. They also\nfound with it a string with eleven knots knitted with needles. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed Surah al-\nFalaq and Surah al-Nas (al-Mu'awwidhatayn). With each verse that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, read one knot was untied and the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, felt\nsome lightness. When the last knot was untied, the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, got up as if\nhe was released from a cord to which he was tied up. Gabriel, peace be upon him, kept saying: 'In the name\nof Allah I cast this incantation on you to protect you from anything that might harm you and that Allah heals\nyou from the resentful envier and the evil eye'. Those around him said: 'O Messenger of Allah, should we not\nhead toward that evil person and kill him?' He said: 'As for me, Allah has cured me, and I dislike causing evil\nto other people'. This is of the forbearance of the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace”.\n\n\nMuhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Ja'far informed us> Abu 'Amr Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-\nHiri> Ahmad ibn 'Ali al-Mawsili> Mujahid ibn Musa> Abu Usamah> Hisham ibn 'Urwa> his father> 'A'ishah,\nmay Allah be well pleased with her, who said: “A spell of black magic was cast on the Prophet, Allah bless\nhim and give him peace, such that he used to imagine that he did things when he did not. He was at my\nplace, one day, and he began imploring Allah in earnest. Then he said: 'Did you not feel, O 'A'ishah, that\nAllah has answered me about that which I have enquired?' I said: 'And what is that, O Messenger of Allah?'\nHe said: 'Two angels came to me...', and he mentioned the whole story”. The whole story is narrated by\nBukhari from 'Ubayd ibn Isma'il from Abu Usamah. The same narration has different channels of\ntransmission in both the authentic collections of Bukhari and Muslim. The book Asbab Nuzul al-Qur'an\nconcludes here, and praise be to Allah, the One, the Munificent, and may Allah bless our master Muhammad,\nhis household and all those who follow them in excellence.",

      "full_narrative": "The commentators of the Qur'an said: “The\nMessenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, had a Jewish servant boy. The Jews approached\nhim and kept after him until he gave them some fallen hair from the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him\npeace, as well as a few teeth from his comb. The Jews used these to cast a spell of black magic on him. The\nperson who was behind this was the Jew Labid ibn al-A'sam. He then put the hair in a well belonging to\nBanu Zurayq called Dharwan. The Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, fell ill for a period\nof six month, during which the hair of his head fell off; he imagined that he slept with his wives when he did\nnot, and was withering away without knowing the reason. As he was one day sleeping, he saw two angels\ncoming to him. One of them sat at his head and the other at his feet. The angel who sat at his head asked:\n'What is wrong with the man?' The second angel responded: 'A spell of black magic was cast on him'. The\nfirst one asked: 'And who is responsible for this sorcery?' The second angel answered: 'It is Labid ibn al-\nA'sam, the Jew'. The first angel asked again: 'What did he use to cast black magic on him?' The second\nangel said: 'He used a comb and fallen hair'. The first angel asked: 'Where is it now?' The second angel said:\n'It is inside the spadix of a palm tree beneath the stepping stone which is inside the well of Dharwan', at\nwhich point the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, woke up. He said: 'O 'A'ishah, do\nyou not think that this is from Allah to inform me of the cause of my illness?' He then sent 'Ali [ibn Abi\nTalib], al-Zubayr [ibn al-'Awwam] and 'Ammar [ibn Yasir] who drained the water of that well as one would\ndrain the dust of henna. They lifted the stone and got the spadix out and found therein some of the hair of\nthe Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, as well a few teeth from his comb. They also\nfound with it a string with eleven knots knitted with needles. Allah, exalted is He, then revealed Surah al-\nFalaq and Surah al-Nas (al-Mu'awwidhatayn). With each verse that the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him\nand give him peace, read one knot was untied and the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, felt\nsome lightness. When the last knot was untied, the Prophet, Allah bless him and give him peace, got up as if\nhe was released from a cord to which he was tied up. Gabriel, peace be upon him, kept saying: 'In the name\nof Allah I cast this incantation on you to protect you from anything that might harm you and that Allah heals\nyou from the resentful envier and the evil eye'. Those around him said: 'O Messenger of Allah, should we not\nhead toward that evil person and kill him?' He said: 'As for me, Allah has cured me, and I dislike causing evil\nto other people'.

As he was one day sleeping, he saw two angels\ncoming to him. One of them sat at his head and the other at his feet. The angel who sat at his head asked:\n'What is wrong with the man?' The second angel responded: 'A spell of black magic was cast on him'. The\nfirst one asked: 'And who is responsible for this sorcery?' The second angel answered: 'It is Labid ibn al-\nA'sam, the Jew'. The first angel asked again: 'What did he use to cast black magic on him?' The second\nangel said: 'He used a comb and fallen hair'. The first angel asked: 'Where is it now?' The second angel said:\n'It is inside the spadix of a palm tree beneath the stepping stone which is inside the well of Dharwan', at\nwhich point the Messenger of Allah, Allah bless him and give him peace, woke up.
