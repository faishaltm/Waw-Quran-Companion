## Project Overview

This is a Python-based Telegram bot that provides detailed linguistic analysis of the Quran. It uses a pre-generated comprehensive JSON file (`quran_comprehensive.json`) which contains a wealth of information, including the Quranic text, translations, morphological data, syntactic dependencies, named entities, tafsir (commentary), asbab al-nuzul (reasons for revelation), and various levels of balaghah (rhetorical) analysis. The bot is designed to be interactive, allowing users to navigate through surahs and verses, and get detailed information about them.

## Building and Running

### Dependencies

The dependencies are listed in `scripts/deployment/requirements.txt`. They include:

*   `python-telegram-bot`
*   `python-dotenv`
*   `openai`
*   `httpx`

### Setup

To run the bot, you need to:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r scripts/deployment/requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Create a `.env` file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `scripts/deployment/` directory with the following content:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
    TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your-telegram-bot-token>
    ```
3.  **Generate the comprehensive data file:**
    The core data file, `quran_comprehensive.json`, is generated by running the `scripts/tools/generate_comprehensive_quran.py` script. This script collects data from various sources in the `data/` directory and merges them into a single file.
    ```bash
    python scripts/tools/generate_comprehensive_quran.py
    ```
4.  **Run the bot:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/deployment/quran_telegram_bot.py
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   The code is well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns. The `api` directory contains the core logic for data loading, session management, and conversation management. The `tools` directory contains scripts for data processing and analysis.
*   The project uses type hints for better code quality and maintainability.
*   The project uses a command-line interface for generating the comprehensive data file.
